People obtain information through purposeful interaction with the environment in a process known as **exploration**. Such active exploration is a key construct in theories of perception and development. The overarching goal of my research program is to understand the real-time and developmental processes that underlie how people gather perceptual information—that is, explore—when guiding motor actions, observing events, and engaging in social interactions. I study exploration across the lifespan (infancy, childhood, adulthood, and old age) using a variety of techniques (psychophysics, eye tracking, computer vision, motion tracking, and naturalistic observation) to reveal exploratory processes at multiple timescales and levels of analysis. I have made empirical contributions in three main lines of research: 1) The **development of visual exploration**, 2) How motor exploration shapes **real-life opportunities for learning**, and 3) How exploratory behavior calibrates **perception of action possibilities**. Furthermore, I have made significant methodological contributions, such as pioneering the first head-mounted eye-tracking method for studying infants’ naturalistic visual exploration (Franchak et al., 2011, *Chi. Dev.*), developing a text-message-based survey system for estimating infants' posture and activity in the home (Franchak, 2019, *Infancy*), and creating a machine-learning classification system for automatically measuring infants' body position in the home from wearable inertial sensors (Franchak et al., 2021, *Frontiers in Psych.*). I contribute to open science by developing and sharing analysis software and by making datasets and analysis code available on the Databrary and OSF repositories.

## The development of visual exploration

What influences where people choose to look to visually explore scenes, and how do those influences change over development? Although screen-based research may offer some insight into the mechanisms of visual attention, my approach much more closely resembles real-life visual exploration by considering the role of head and body positioning. Accordingly, I pioneered new techniques (mobile infant eye tracking, computer vision analyses) to study visual exploration beyond screens.

### Bottom-up and top-down influences on attention 

Prior work suggests that the visual appearance of a target (bottom-up influences) captures the eye gaze of young infants, but older infants' gaze is driven more by a target's meaning (top-down influences). My graduate student, Kellan Kadooka, and I challenged this view based on data we collected from infants and children watching video clips (Franchak et al., 2016, *Infancy*; Kadooka & Franchak, 2020, *Dev. Psych.*). Using a wider set of videos and range of ages than in previous studies, we failed to find evidence of a global age-related shift in attention from bottom-up to top-down features. Instead, participants of all ages prioritized which features are most important to attend to from moment to moment, which varied according to the scene. Moreover, we found that media conventions (e.g., centering of faces in the scene) more strongly influence fixations to faces in videos compared with bottom-up saliency in both infants and children (Franchak & Kadooka, in revision). 

### Exploring with eyes, head, and body 

Beyond screen-based tasks, it is important to consider how looking is a motor action---observers must coordinate movements of their eyes, heads, and bodies to explore in all directions (Franchak, 2020, *Perception as Information Detection*; Franchak, 2020, *Psych. of Learning & Motivation*). How does the motor act of looking shape how observers visually explore, and how do motor influences change over development? In earlier work, I used mobile eye trackers to reveal that infants' and children's body size and position shapes what they see (Franchak & Adolph, 2010, *Vis. Research*; Franchak et al., 2011, *Chi Dev*; Kretch, Franchak, & Adolph, 2014, *Chi Dev*).  

More recently, I published a paper in *Developmental Science* showing that infants' real-time body position affects social gaze (Franchak et al., 2018): Infants less often see caregivers’ faces while infants are crawling than while they are sitting or upright. Further work in my lab asked how infants learn to orient their heads to center information in view---a previously unstudied aspect of attentional development. My graduate student, Chuan Luo, and I showed that infants can more easily center objects in view when they are in a sitting/upright position compared with when they are crawling (Luo & Franchak, 2020, *PLoS ONE*). I also identified developmental changes in how infants orient their heads to center faces versus objects (Franchak et al., in revision). Two-year-olds (but not one-year-olds) center objects in view at the expense of caregivers’ faces, which facilitates looking at objects for guiding the hands to reach and explore objects (Franchak & Yu, 2015, *Proc. Cog Sci Society*). 

Two ongoing projects in my lab investigate how the coordination of eyes and head support visual exploration and how such coordination develops from infancy to adulthood. By pairing inertial sensing (to measure head rotation) with mobile eye tracking, my mentees and I found that adults' search in a large outdoor environment is driven more by modifying head movements compared with eye movements (Franchak et al., 2021, *PLoS ONE*). However, data collection with children was halted due to COVID-19. We also reported preliminary data testing whether the motor effort of rotating the head interacts with targets' bottom-up appearance to influence where infants look (Kadooka et al., 2020, ICIS conference presentation), but data collection is delayed due to the pandemic. 

### Methodological contributions 

To facilitate this work, I led the development of the first head-mounted eye tracking methodology to measure visual exploration in freely-moving infants (Franchak et al., 2011, *Chi Dev*), which has now been adopted by numerous laboratories. While at UCR, I co-organized a workshop at the 2018 International Congress of Infant Studies, wrote two chapters (Franchak, 2017, *Cambridge Ency.*; Franchak & Yu, under review, *Advances in Child Devel.*), collaborated on the development of computer vision analyses (Lee et al., 2014, *IEEE CVPR*), and co-authored a video tutorial article (Slone et al., 2018, *JOVE*). I was recognized as an APS Rising Star and a Visiting Scholar at the McPherson Eye Research Institute in recognition of these contributions, and I am an eye-tracking consultant on two federally-funded grants (NSF, PI: Montag; NICHD, PI: Adolph).

## Motor exploration shapes real-life opportunities for learning

Infants' opportunities for learning about objects and people in daily life depend on what they see. If the motor system influences visual exploration, what are the potential consequences for development? In a recent position paper (Franchak, 2020, *Curr. Opin. Psych.*), I hypothesized that differences in the time that infants spend in different body positions---creating different opportunities for seeing faces and objects---may facilitate later development of language and spatial cognition.

With support from a UCR Regents Faculty Fellowship, I devised a novel ecological momentary assessment (EMA) method to measure body position in 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month-olds infants by notifying caregivers throughout the day via text message to ask about infants’ current position (Franchak, 2019, *Infancy*). Older infants spent more time upright compared with crawling, which we previously showed facilitates infants' view of faces and objects. Moreover, motor development (learning to sit and walk) altered body position rates, which in turn changes infants’ opportunities for learning about faces and objects. To better characterize infants' everyday motor experiences, my mentees and I developed and validated a new technique using wearable inertial sensors and machine learning classification to continuously measure infants' body position in the home (Franchak, Scott, & Luo, in press, *Frontiers in Psychology*). I was awarded a 4-year, \$754,957 NSF Developmental Sciences grant to use the new inertial sensing method combined with EMA and day-long audio recording to test whether changes in body position following the onset of independent sitting and independent walking facilitate vocabulary development. Furthermore, I was awarded an NICHD PLAY Project subaward to collect video observations of everyday infant-caregiver play in the home (including body position and object experiences). As an extension of my interest in everyday experience, I am part of a UCR Center for Health Disparities Research Grant to investigate how home experiences contribute to psychopathology and anxiety in Latinx youth. Latinx youth are at disproportionate risk for anxiety. Characterizing the contextual and sociocultural factors that surround the development of anxiety in this population can facilitate preventative measures and interventions aimed at reducing societal inequities in mental health. 

## Exploratory behavior calibrates perception of action possibilities

Possibilities for action depend on the fit between the body and the environment. For example, whether it is possible to walk under a tree branch without hitting the head depends on body height relative to the height of the branch. Perceiving possibilities for action is a challenge because bodies change in size, requiring *recalibration* of perception. In this 3rd line of work, I study how people recalibrate after experiencing a change in their bodies and how the ability to recalibrate changes over development. My studies reveal that successful recalibration depends on whether people explore in ways that generate information about how action possibilities have changed.

### Real-time learning from exploratory practice 

Prior work suggested that exploratory practice is not required for recalibration in most tasks (e.g., navigating under barriers or on steps of different heights); general movement experience is sufficient. My work as a graduate student hinted that in another task---squeezing through doorways---exploratory practice does facilitate accurate perception of action possibilities (Franchak et al., 2010, *Vis Res*; Franchak & Adolph, 2014, *APP*). However, it was unclear whether practicing was required for recalibration because practicing the action (squeezing through doorways) also provides general movement experience while participants walked to the doorway.

I published 5 papers while at UCR to disentangle *why* practice leads to recalibration for some actions but not for others. Does practice simply provide a way to generate movement experience, or is outcome feedback (successfully fitting vs failing to fit) important for recalibration? I found that participants who only received movement experience without outcome feedback (walking around the lab and pressing the backpack against a wall) failed to recalibrate, suggesting that practice recalibrates perception because it provides outcome feedback (Franchak, 2017, *APP*). Two papers showed that the role of outcome feedback is task-dependent: Outcome feedback does not calibrate perception in a fitting (compared to squeezing) version of the task (Franchak, 2020, *QJEP*), and the role of feedback differs for judgments of vertical versus horizontal reaching (Gagnon et al., 2021, *IEEE VR*). To determine whether any other means of exploring (besides practice) would lead to recalibration, my students and I examined how participants spontaneously chose to explore (Labinger, Monson, & Franchak, 2018, *PLoS ONE*). Participants were motivated to succeed---they were rewarded with \$5 if they made accurate judgments---so they tried various forms of exploration (touching the doorway, walking around the room, practicing fitting through). Despite the variety of exploratory methods, only participants who chose to practice made accurate judgments. Finally, prior work shows that general movement experience leads to *gradual* recalibration in the stair-stepping task. An undergraduate honors student and I tested the time course of recalibration in the squeezing task (Franchak & Somoano, 2018, *EBR*), and we discovered that practice *rapidly* recalibrated perception, further supporting the claim that outcome feedback, not general movement experience, recalibrates perception in the doorway squeezing task. 

### Development of exploration for perceptual-motor recalibration

My earlier work shows that perception of possibilities for action improves through infancy and childhood (Franchak & Adolph, 2012, *Dev Psych*; Ishak, Franchak, & Adolph, 2014, *JECP*). However, few studies have investigated the development of recalibration to altered body size. At UCR, I showed that the ability to use information from practice to recalibrate improves from 4 to 11 years (Franchak, 2019, *JECP*). Although 11-year-olds show an adult-like ability to perceive their unaltered abilities, they lag behind adults in a recalibration task. An intriguing finding was that younger children made riskier decisions and were thus more likely to attempt fitting through doorways---practicing---compared with older children and adults. My work implies that changes in body size may increase the likelihood of motor errors and that children’s deficit in perceptual-motor recalibration contributes to higher rates of accidental injury in childhood.
