"Franchak, J. M., & Kadooka, K.",2022,"Age differences in orienting to faces in dynamic scenes depend on face centering, not visual saliency.",,Infancy,,Journal,2022-FranchakKadooka-Infancy.pdf,,"The current study investigated how infants (6-24 months), children (2-12 years), and adults dif- fer in how visual cues—visual saliency and centering—guide their attention to faces in videos. We report a secondary analysis of Kadooka and Franchak (2020), in which observers’ eye movements were recorded during viewing of television clips containing a variety of faces. For every face on every video frame, we calculated its visual saliency (based on both static and dynamic image features) and calculated how close the face was to the center of the image. Results revealed that participants of every age looked more often at each face when it was more salient compared to less salient. In contrast, centering did not increase the likelihood that infants looked at a given face, but in later childhood and adulthood centering became a stronger cue for face looking. A control analysis determined that the age-related change in centering was specific to face looking; participants of all ages were more likely to look in the center of the image, and this center bias did not change with age. The implications for using videos in educational and diagnostic contexts are discussed.",1

Gilmore (Eds.),"Advances in Child Development and Behavior, Vol 62","(pp. 61-92). Cambridge, MA: Academic Press.",Chapter,2022-FranchakYu-Advances.pdf,,"Head-mounted eye tracking is a new method that allows researchers to catch a glimpse of what infants and children see during naturalistic activities. In this chapter, we review how mobile, wearable eye trackers improve the construct validity of important developmental constructs, such as visual object experiences and social attention, in ways that would be impossible using screen-based eye tracking. Head-mounted eye tracking improves ecological validity by allowing researchers to present more realistic and complex visual scenes, create more interactive experimental situations, and examine how the body influences what infants and children see. As with any new method, there are difficulties to overcome. Accordingly, we identify what aspects of head-mounted eye tracking study design affect the measurement quality, interpretability of the results, and efficiency of gathering data. Moreover, we provide a summary of best practices aimed at allowing researchers to make well-informed decisions about whether and how to apply head-mounted eye tracking to their own research questions.",0
