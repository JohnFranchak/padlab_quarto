Postural transitions facilitate perceptual-motor exploration because different postures afford unique learning opportunities. However, extant studies on postural transitions are limited to laboratory play sessions, so it is unknown how frequently transitions occur in daily life. In the present study, we assessed infants’ daily experiences with postural transitions. In particular, we tested whether the frequency of transitions and the type of transitions change with infants’ increasing walking experience. We developed a novel video-based ecological momentary assessment (vEMA) to longitudinally collect videos of infants’ activities throughout the day in their home environment at 11 and 13 months of age. We identified postural transitions in the resulting 3210 video observations collected from N = 44 infants across the United States, which revealed that the frequency and type of transitions differed according to walking experience. The frequency of postural transitions decreased with accumulated walking experience. Infants with greater walking experience more frequently engaged in transitions involving upright postures in their daily lives.",0

Infants may spend long periods in one position, such as sitting in a highchair, followed by periods of switching positions (e.g., prone and upright), such as during play. Speech input has been linked with infants’ placement and motor development (Karasik et al., 2014; Malachowski et al., 2023). Here, we extend past work to ask whether adults speak more frequently depending on infants’ time spent in different body positions throughout the day. We gathered home recordings from 64 infants in two age groups, 4-7 months and 11-14 months, using movement sensors to measure body position and a LENA® audio recorder to estimate adult word count. Data were analyzed in 10-minute bins throughout the day to determine whether within-day differences in infants' time spent in each position were associated with the frequency of adult’s speech. Indeed, increased time spent supine and prone predicted fewer adult words, whereas increased time sitting and held predicted increases in word count. Upright was age dependent, with more time spent upright predicting an increase in word count for younger infants, but a decrease for older infants. These findings reveal the importance of considering infants’ body position in understanding speech input and subsequent language development.",0

Unlike past work that used retrospective estimates, we used an ecological momentary assessment sampling method to obtain direct reports of activities from infants’ caregivers via text-message surveys. The resulting data illustrate that play is the most frequent activity within the first year, accounting for half of infants’ waking time. Other frequent activities, such as mealtimes and errands, contribute significantly to how infants spend their time. Older infants spend more time playing and eating/drinking and less time napping and being comforted compared with younger infants. Importantly, different macro-level activities facilitate and constrain what infants do from moment to moment, such as hold objects, sit, and stand, suggesting that the composition of infants’ daily routines shapes opportunities for perceptual-motor learning.",0

How do everyday positioning experiences change with the acquisition of postural skills like sitting? This study investigated relations between sitting status (whether infants have achieved a sitting milestone), sitting age (amount of time before or after that milestone), and everyday positioning experience. Forty-three infants participated at 4, 5, 6, and/or 7 months of chronological age. Everyday experience was measured using Ecological Momentary Assessment: Caregivers reported infants’ current position repeatedly throughout their daily activities. The best predictors of everyday sitting experience were chronological age and overall sitting age, calculated from the first day infants sat using hands for support; hands-free sitting age, calculated from the first day infants sat without hands, did not uniquely contribute. Sitting experience supplanted supine experience, which decreased with overall sitting age; the effect of overall sitting age on prone experience varied with chronological age. Time restrained by an adult decreased only with chronological age, and time restrained by a device was not related to chronological or sitting age. Results suggest that the continuous development of sitting skill changes the positioning composition of infants’ everyday unrestrained floor time.  ",0

In Experiment 1, participants were asked to copy models over repeated trials to test the effect of practice. We recorded participants’ eye-head-body movements while copying models. We calculated how frequently they looked at the models, the total time used to complete each trial, and the eye-head-body rotations during model looks. The results showed that people looked less frequently and reduced the effortful body movement to improve efficiency after repeated practice. The same task was used in Experiment 2 except that we restricted participants’ head movement while copying the models and then removed the restriction to induce strategy change. The results showed that participants opted for a less effortful strategy during head restriction and retained the effort-saving strategy after head restriction was removed.",0

The problem seems intractable if a large number of successful and unsuccessful trials are infeasible. We offer a solution based on estimates of task-specific variability pooled across the sample. Using a dataset of adult performance in throwing and walking tasks, we show that mischaracterizing the slope leads to unacceptably large errors in estimates of performance levels that undermine analyses of risk perception. We introduce a “pooled-slope” solution that approximates estimates of individual variability in performance and outperforms arbitrary assumptions about performance variability within and across tasks. We discuss the advantages of objectively measuring performance based on the rate of successful attempts—modeled via psychometric functions—for improving comparisons of risk across participants, tasks, and studies.",0

However, real-world visual exploration entails active movements of both eyes and head to bring relevant areas in view. Thus, relatively little is known about how infants coordinate their eyes and heads to structure their visual experiences. Infants were tested every 3 months from 9 to 24 months while they played with their caregiver and three toys while sitting in a highchair at a table. Infants wore a head-mounted eye tracker that measured eye movement towards each of the visual targets (caregiver’s face and toys) and how targets were oriented within the head-centered field of view. With age, infants increasingly aligned novel toys in the center of their head-centered field of view at the expense of their caregiver’s face. Both faces and toys were better centered in view during longer looking events, suggesting that infants of all ages aligned their eyes and head to sustain attention. The bias in infants’ head-centered field of view could not be accounted for by manual action: Held toys were more poorly centered compared with non-held toys. We discuss developmental factors—attentional, motoric, cognitive, and social—that may explain why infants increasingly adopted biased viewpoints with age.",0

How can we produce similar data in service of measuring infants’ everyday motor behaviors, such as body position? The aim of the current study was to validate long form recordings of infant position (supine, prone, sitting, upright, held by caregiver) based on machine learning classification of data from inertial sensors worn on infants’ ankles and hips. Using over 100 hours of video recordings synchronized with inertial sensor data from infants in their homes, we demonstrate that body position classifications are sufficiently accurate to measure infant behavior. Moreover, classification remained accurate when predicting behavior later in the session when infants and caregivers were unsupervised and went about their normal activities, showing that the method can handle the challenge of measuring unconstrained, natural activity. Next, we show that the inertial sensing method has convergent validity by replicating age differences in body position found using other methods with full-day data captured from inertial sensors. We end the paper with a discussion of the novel opportunities that long form motor recordings afford for understanding infant learning and development.",0

We focus on infancy when basic action systems are acquired—posture, locomotion, manual actions, and facial actions—and we adopt a developmental systems perspective to understand the causes and consequences of developmental change. Experience facilitates improvements in motor behavior and infants accumulate immense amounts of varied everyday experience with all the basic action systems. At every point in development, perception guides behavior by providing feedback about the results of just prior movements and information about what to do next. Across development, new motor behaviors provide new inputs for perception. Thus, motor development opens up new opportunities for acquiring knowledge and acting on the world, instigating cascades of developmental changes in perceptual, cognitive, and social domains.",0

It can capture visual attention patterns from infancy through adulthood. However, commonly used screen-based paradigms are limited in their depiction of how individuals process information as they interact with the environment in “real life”. Mobile eye tracking (MET) records participant-perspective gaze in the context of active behavior. Recent technological developments in MET hardware enable researchers to capture egocentric vision as early as infancy and across the lifespan. However, challenges remain in MET data collection, processing, and analysis. The present paper aims to provide an introduction and practical guide to starting researchers in the field to facilitate the use of MET in psychological research with a wide range of age groups. First, we provide a general introduction to MET. Next, we briefly review MET studies in adults and children that provide new insights into attention and its roles in cognitive and socioemotional functioning. We then discuss technical issues relating to MET data collection and provide guidelines for data quality inspection, gaze annotations, data visualization, and statistical analyses. Lastly, we conclude by discussing the future directions of MET implementation. Open-source programs for MET data quality inspection, data visualization, and analysis are shared publicly. ",0

Using data from over 4,000 EMA samples from N = 62 infants recruited from across the United States and sampled longitudinally, we measured changes in the base rates of different activities in daily life. With age, infants spent more time unrestrained. With the onset of walking, infants spent less time sitting and prone and more time upright. Although rates of object holding did not change with age or walking ability, we found that infants who can walk hold objects more often in an upright position compared with nonwalkers. We discuss how accurately measuring changes in lived experiences serves to constrain theories about developmental mechanisms.",0

But for some actions, performance is inherently variable. That is, people cannot consistently perform the same action under the same environmental conditions with the same level of success. Decades of research show that practice performing an action improves perception of affordances. However, prior work did not address whether practice with more versus less variable actions is equally effective at improving perceptual judgments. Thirty adults judged affordances for walking versus throwing a beanbag through narrow doorways before and after 75 practice trials walking and throwing beanbags through doorways of different widths. We fit a “success” function through each participant’s practice data in each task and calculated performance variability as the slope of the function. Performance for throwing was uniformly more variable than for walking. Accordingly, absolute judgment error was larger for throwing than walking at both pretest and posttest. However, absolute error reduced proportionally in both tasks with practice, suggesting that practice improves perceptual judgments equally well for more and less variable actions. Moreover, individual differences in variability in performance were unrelated to absolute, constant, and variable error in perceptual judgments. Overall, results indicate that practice is beneficial for calibrating perceptual judgments, even when practice provides mixed feedback about success under the same environmental conditions. ",0

When information is easy to gather with minimal movement, people choose to look more frequently and rely on less on memorization, however, they reduce motor effort and rely on memory more when looking requires larger (and more effortful) shifts of gaze. This paper investigated the eye-head-body movements that guided looking as well as participants' trade-off between using motor effort and memory in a copying task. We add to prior work by characterizing the coordination between eyes, head, and body required to look at targets at different angles. In the task, participants copied models onto a board while wearing a mobile eye tracker that measured eye rotations and motion sensors that measured head rotations. We manipulated the angle of the model relative to the participant and the memorization difficulty of the models. Results showed that the eye movements contributed more to small gaze shifts but the head and body contributed more as the angle of the target increased (requiring larger amplitude shifts of gaze). Participants chose to look frequently when models were adjacent to the workspace, but chose to rely more on memory for models that required greater shifts of gaze. Memorization difficulty affected the trade-off such that participants used more memory when the models were easy to remember. We discuss how participants' decisions to look versus remember may depend on the contribution of eyes, head, and body to shift gaze by varying amplitudes.",0

Children between 3.5 and 6.5 years of age (N = 70) watched a video of two on-screen characters solving problems. Children’s eye movements were recorded during viewing. Each of the two on-screen characters consistently displayed either high or low effort to solve four problems (familiarization). For the final problem (testing), the two characters exerted the same level of effort as each other and used unique solutions to solve the problem. Children then solved the final problem themselves using real objects. Children could selectively use either the high or low effort character’s solution demonstrated in the video. Lastly, children explicitly judged how good the characters were at solving problems. Younger children were more likely to use the high effort character’s solution, whereas older children were more likely to use the low effort character’s solution. Younger children allocated more attention to the high effort character than the low effort character, but this pattern was modified by age such that children’s gaze to the low effort character increased with age. Children’s explicit credibility judgments did not differ by character effort or child age.

Results revealed that participants of every age looked more often at each face when it was more salient compared to less salient. In contrast, centering did not increase the likelihood that infants looked at a given face, but in later childhood and adulthood centering became a stronger cue for face looking.

The only consensus has been that, all else being equal, easy tasks can be performed by more individuals than hard tasks, and easy tasks are usually preferred over hard tasks. Feghhi and Rosenbaum (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 45, 983–994, 2019) asked whether task difficulty might reflect a single amodal quantity. Based on their subjects’ two-alternative forced-choice data from tasks involving choices of tasks with graded physical and mental challenges, the authors showed that the difficulty of passing through a narrow gap rather than a wide gap was psychologically equivalent to memorizing an extra .55 digits. In the present study, we extended this approach by adding new arguments for the hypothesis that task difficulty might reflect a single amodal quantity (inspired by considerations of physics, economics, and the common code hypothesis for the study of perception and action), and we tested narrower gaps than before to see whether we would find a larger equivalent memory-digit. Consistent with our prediction, we obtained a value of .95.

Judgments of action capabilities within a VE provide a good measure of perceptual fidelity — the notion of how closely perception and action in the VE match that in the real world — and can also assess how perception for action may be calibrated with visual feedback based on one’s own actions. In the current study we tested judg- ments of action capabilities within a VE for two different reaching behaviors: reaching out and reaching up. Our goal was to assess whether feedback from actual reaching improves judgments and if any recalibration due to feedback differed across reaching behaviors. We first measured participants’ actual reaching out and reaching up capabilities so that feedback trials could be scaled to their actual abil- ities. Participants then completed blocks of alternating perceptual adjustment and feedback trials. In adjustment trials, they adjusted a virtual target to a distance perceived to be just reachable. In feedback trials, they viewed targets that were farther or closer than their actual reach, decided whether the target was reachable, and then reached out to the target to receive visual feedback from a hand-held con- troller. The first feedback block manipulated the target distance to be 30% over or under actual reach and subsequent blocks decreased the deviation to 20%, 10% and 5% of actual reach. We found that for both reaching behaviors, reach was initially overestimated, and then perceptual estimations decreased to become more accurate over feed- back blocks. Accuracy in the feedback trials themselves showed that targets just beyond reach were more difficult to judge correctly. This study establishes a straightforward methodology that can be used for calibration of actions in VEs and has implications for applications that depend on accurate reaching within VEs.",0

To test the global shift hypothesis, we recorded eye movements of 89 children (6 months to 10 years) and adults while they viewed 7 video clips. We measured the extent to which each participant attended to faces and to salient areas for each video. There was no evidence of global age-related changes in attention: Neither feature showed consistent increases or decreases with age. Moreover, windowed analyses within each stimulus video revealed significant moment-to-moment variations in the relation between age and each visual feature (via a bootstrapping analysis). For some time windows, adults looked more often at both feature types compared to infants and children. However, for other time windows, the pattern was reversed—younger participants looked more at faces and salient locations. Lack of consistent directional effects provides strong evidence against the global shift hypothesis. We suggest an alternative explanation: Over development, observers increasingly prioritize when and where to look by learning to track which features are relevant within a scene. Implications for the development of visual attention and children’s understanding of screen-based media are discussed.",0

In doing so, I discuss how the ecological validity of research depends on variations in three factors: visual characteristics of stimuli, the opportunity for participants to interact with their surroundings, and participants’ ability to move their bodies. In particular, the long-standing reliance on stationary, screen tasks has precluded progress in understanding the last factor—how anatomical, biomechanical, and physiological aspects of the body influence where observers look. I argue that each factor is vital to revealing the flexibility, adaptiveness, and efficiency of everyday visual exploration.",0

We tested this hypothesis by measuring whether calibration transferred between two affordances for passing through openings: squeezing sideways through doorways without becoming stuck and fitting sideways through doorways while avoiding collision. Participants wore a backpack to alter affordances for passage and create a need for perceptual recalibration. Calibration failed to transfer between the two actions (e.g., practising squeezing through doorways calibrated perception of squeezing but not fitting). Differences between squeezing and fitting affordances that might have required different information for perception and recalibration are explored to understand why calibration did not transfer. In light of these results, we propose a revised hypothesis—calibration transfers between affordances on the basis of both functional and informational similarity.",0

Task influences on visual exploration are even more striking when observers are free to engage in everyday actions that involve movement. Maintaining awareness of the visual world can be thought of as the most basic “task” of visual exploration. Gibson emphasized that a nested visual system—the eyes within the head within the body—is coordinated to visually explore one’s surroundings. Moving the head is important for minimizing extreme eye movements, however, head movements themselves should also be minimized to make visual exploration efficient because head movements are effortful. Looking ahead, we must test how observers’ active visual exploration supports perception of a stable visual world.",0

The current study compared younger children (4–7 years), older children (8–11 years), and adults as they decided whether they could squeeze through doorways of varying widths. To test for age-related changes in recalibration to modified abilities versus perception of unmodified abilities, half of the participants wore a backpack while making judgments and squeezing through doorways and half did not. Results indicated that judgment accuracy improved with age but that participants had more difficulty when recalibrating to modified abilities. Bias in decision making also changed with age; whereas younger children made riskier decisions by attempting to fit through impossibly small doorways, older children were more cautious. Some particularly cautious participants never generated practice feedback by attempting (and failing) to fit through smaller doorways, which prevented them from recalibrating.

Younger infants spend more time held, supine, and reclined, whereas older infants spend more time sitting and upright. Body position experiences differed substantially between same-age infants who possess a motor skill (e.g., ability to sit or walk) compared with those who did not, suggesting that developing motor skills change infants’ everyday experiences.

Results revealed that participants made efficient decisions about when to explore by approaching and practicing—they most often explored doorways that were near the limit of their abilities, and participants explored less often as their perceptual calibration improved.

However, past work could not rule out the possibility that practicing the action produced perceptual–motor feedback besides outcome feedback that facilitated recalibration. The results of two experiments support the hypothesis that recalibration in a doorway squeezing task depends on outcome feedback as opposed to perceptual–motor feedback. After putting on a backpack that changed participants’ doorway squeezing ability, affordance judgments were uncalibrated and remained so even after making repeated judgments. However, after practicing the action, which produced outcome feedback, judgments rapidly calibrated. Moreover, the order of feedback information directly impacted participants’ judgments: Participants did not recalibrate if they received only success experience or only failure experience. Recalibration only occurred after participants received both types of feedback experiences, suggesting that outcome feedback is necessary for recalibration in the doorway squeezing task.

However, common laboratory paradigms for studying dyadic interaction oversimplify the act of looking at the partner's face by seating infants and caregivers face to face in stationary positions. In less constrained conditions when both partners are freely mobile, infants and caregivers must move their heads and bodies to look at each other. We hypothesized that face looking and mutual gaze for each member of the dyad would decrease with increased motor costs of looking. To test this hypothesis, 12-month-old crawling and walking infants and their parents wore head-mounted eye trackers to record eye movements of each member of the dyad during locomotor free play in a large toy-filled playroom. Findings revealed that increased motor costs decreased face looking and mutual gaze: Each partner looked less at the other's face when their own posture or the other's posture required more motor effort to gain visual access to the other's face. Caregivers mirrored infants' posture by spending more time down on the ground when infants were prone, perhaps to facilitate face looking. Infants looked more at toys than at their caregiver's face, but caregivers looked at their infant's face and at toys in equal amounts. Furthermore, infants looked less at toys and faces compared to studies that used stationary tasks, suggesting that the attentional demands differ in an unconstrained locomotor task.

Head-mounted eye tracking complements other experimental methods by enhancing opportunities for data collection in more ecologically valid contexts through increased portability and freedom of head and body movements compared to screen-based eye tracking.

Many developmental studies employ remote eye trackers: High-speed cameras record infants’ eye movements while they sit and watch stimuli displayed on a computer monitor (Aslin, 2011). Remote eye tracking is appropriate for studying visual selection in tasks that require precise control over the stimuli. However, studying eye movements in controlled, laboratory contexts cannot adequately inform on infants’ visual selection in natural tasks or during their everyday visual experiences over development. In the real world, infants select what they see and they do so while mobile.

Most affordances for fitting the body through openings are recalibrated without feedback from practicing the action; locomotion exploration is sufficient. The present study used a different fitting task, squeezing through doorways, to determine whether locomotor experience was sufficient for recalibrating to changes in body size that altered affordances.

Using converging measures, we found a clear developmental progression with age such that the youngest children performed near chance on the illusory contour discrimination, whereas 7- and 8-year-olds performed nearly perfectly, as did adults. There was clear evidence of a gradual shift from a local processing strategy to a global one; young children looked predominantly at and touched the “pacman” inducers of the illusory form, whereas older children and adults looked predominantly at and touched the middle of the form.

Afterward, participants walked through the openings, so that we could determine which opening sizes elicited gait modifications. Participants turned their shoulders with more space available than the space they left themselves for ducking. Larger buffers for horizontal openings may reflect different spatial requirements created by lateral sway of the body during walking compared to vertical bounce. In addition, greater variability of turning from trial to trial compared with ducking may lead walkers to adopt a more conservative buffer to avoid errors. Verbal judgments accurately predicted whether openings required gait modifications. For horizontal openings, participants’ judgments were best predicted by the body’s dynamic abilities, not static shoulder width.

Children and adults wore a wireless, head-mounted eye-tracker during a visual search task in a room cluttered with obstacles. They spontaneously walked, jumped, and ran through the room, stepping up, down, and over obstacles. Both children and adults navigated adaptively without fixating obstacles, however, adults fixated less often than children. We discuss several possibilities for why obstacle navigation may shift from foveal to peripheral control over development.",0

Despite hundreds of studies describing infants' visual exploration of experimental stimuli, researchers know little about where infants look during everyday interactions. Head-mounted eye-trackers have provided many insights into natural vision in adults, but methods and equipment that work well with adults are not suitable for infants---the equipment is prohibitively big and calibration procedures too demanding. We outline the first method for studying mobile infants' visual behavior during natural interactions. We used a new, specially designed head-mounted eye-tracker to record 6 infants' gaze as they played with mothers in a room full of toys and obstacles. Using this method, we measured how infants employed gaze while navigating obstacles, manipulating objects, and interacting with mothers. Results revealed new insights into visually guided locomotor and manual action and social interaction.",0

The first is to describe flexibility in motor action. Balance and locomotion in infants are used as a test case for understanding three aspects of behavioral flexibility—adaptive motor decisions, modification of ongoing activity, and new means to achieve a goal. The second aim is to illuminate the links between flexibility and development. In particular, it demonstrates that flexibility is acquired during development and that developmental changes both facilitate and impede its acquisition. It is shown that flexibility does not automatically appear when infants acquire new forms of balance and locomotion. Instead, flexibility is learned over many weeks of everyday locomotor experience in a newly acquired posture. Infants learn how to learn as they acquire the appropriate exploratory behaviors for generating information about the current constraints on action and potential alternatives for achieving their goals. Two kinds of limits on flexibility are described—one created by developmental transitions to new postural control systems and the other created by the nature of the perceptual information for friction and rigidity.",0
