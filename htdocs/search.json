    "text": "COVID was going around in my family the day before the conference, so fearing that I’d miss the live presentation I recorded a version to share in case I was absent. Luckily I was able to present the talk live, but I kept the recording to share (embedded below). It was fun to engage with an audience interested in eye tracking, and I took the time to talk about some issues about ecological validity in eye tracking research that have been cropping up in my papers for years. This talk in particular followed 3 facets of ecological validity that I wrote about in this chapter.\n\n\nAbstract: Laboratory studies of attention examine how visual features in photographic and video stimuli shape visual exploration over development. However, exploration in daily life differs from the laboratory in several ways that impact ecological validity. First, real-world visual scenes are more diverse and complex compared with laboratory stimuli. Second, real-world tasks offer opportunities for interaction as opposed to passive viewing. Third, real-world visual exploration depends on full-body movement to coordinate the eyes, head, and body when orienting to different locations in the world. In this talk, I will describe two sets of studies to illustrate how these aspects of ecological validity impact our understanding of visual exploration. The first set of studies highlights the role of video stimuli in drawing conclusions about visual attention development through screen-based eye tracking. The second set of studies employs head-mounted eye tracking and inertial sensing of head rotation to reveal the role that interactive tasks and motor control play in determining how infants and adults gather visual information."

    "text": "Our talk focused on changes in the time infants spend in different body positions and holding objects after they learn to walk independently. We used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to ask caregivers to look at their infants multiple times per day in response to text message prompts; caregivers acted as reporters to tell us what infants were doing at the moment. Caregivers reported behaviors over 4 days when infants were 10, 11, 12, and 13 months old so that we could see what changed in infants who began to walk over that period.\n\n\n\nFigure. If infants were locomoting or stationary, caregivers answered a follow-up question about infants’ body position\n\n\nEven at the same age, infants who could walk had different motor experiences compared with infants who could not. Walkers spent less time prone, less time sitting, and less time restrained (held by caregivers or placed in a seating device). What increased was how much time walkers spent upright, standing or walking on two feet.\n\n\n\nFigure. Extrapolated changes in time spent in different activities for 10-month-old non-walkers, 13-month-old non-walkers, and 13-month-old walkers\n\n\nLearning to walk changed the context of everyday object holding. Although the time spent holding objects did not change with age or with walking ability (all infants held objects for about 4.5 hours/day), walking infants spent more time holding objects in an upright position, but non-walkers held objects far more while sitting.\n\n\n\nFigure. Extrapolated changes object holding for non-walkers vs. walkers\n\n\nIf you want to see more, the slides are up on Github. I made the presentation using Quarto’s reveal.js option. I never gave a talk without Keynote or Powerpoint before, and I had a lot of fun building it (all the graphs and statistics are coded in R to create the slides, similar to Rmarkdown)."

Faces vary over time in how salient (shaded areas) and centered (orange lines) they are in a scene.\n\n\nParticipants from 6 months to 12 years and adults watched 7 videos while their eyes were tracked. We determined each frame that each face was looked at by every participant. We used each a mixed-effect generalized linear model to predict the likelihood that each face was looked on a given frame based on salience and centering.\n\n\n\nFigure. Model estimates showing whether saliency/centering increased the likelihood of face looking within each age group.\n\n\nFor infants and toddlers, only face salience served as a cue. They were more likely to fixate more salient faces. With age, centering emerged as a significant cue. By adulthood, salience and centering interact to boost the likelihood of face looking.\nMore work is needed to determine why older but not younger participants prioritize centered faces. Possibly, experience with television as a medium plays a role. Viewers may learn the conventions of television, such as that important characters are often framed in the center of view.\nA preprint of the accepted article is available here.\nRead more on UCR news."

    "text": "For the past few years, the lab has been using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to measure infants’ everyday experiences by prompting parents throughout the day to respond to short surveys about infants’ body position, object manipulation, and activity. We published one paper showing how the proportion of time infants spend held and supine decreases while time spent sitting and upright increases over the first year of life (Franchak, 2019), and at the recent ICIS Dr. Franchak presented longitudinal work showing how motor and object experiences change when infants learn to walk. Although EMA is a promising technique for characterizing infants’ experiences across the day without direct observation, it’s limiting to only know the answers to a few text-based questions.\nThe JSMF Opportunity Award funds a new project that will ask caregivers to record 10-second video snippets using their mobile phones in a new “video EMA” (vEMA) procedure. Gathering vEMA clips across the day and over multiple days will provide richer data than text-based methods while still avoiding the limitations of brief home or lab visits. One aim of the project is to automatically classify infants’ body position (sitting, supine, prone, upright) from videos by using computer vision algorithms that automatically detect body landmarks.\n\n\n\nFigure. Open-pose detection of body landmarks in an infant in different positions\n\n\nData from the new vEMA method will allow the lab to answer new questions about how learning to walk alters infants’ everyday experiences. The project will track infants from 11 months when they cannot yet walk to 13 months, when about half of infants will have learned to walk. An advantage of the new video EMA method is that it will allow coders to examine not just whether infants are holding an object, but what object they are holding.\n\n\n\nFigure. vEMA data for coding object holding\n\n\nThe richer data captured by vEMA will allow the lab to assess whether learning to walk changes the frequency that infants explore or encouter different kinds of objects in their homes."

In her poster, Lynn tested whether infants who could sit independently at 6 months compared to infants who could not sit at 6 months differed in how much time they spent restrained at 5 months. Preliminary results trended towards showing that less restrained time (either in a device or by a parent) may be linked with the acquisition of sitting, which will be confirmed when the final sample is collected."
