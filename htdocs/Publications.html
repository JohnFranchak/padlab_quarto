We report a secondary analysis of Kadooka and Franchak (2020), in which observers’ eye movements were recorded during viewing of television clips containing a variety of faces. For every face on every video frame, we calculated its visual saliency (based on both static and dynamic image features) and calculated how close the face was to the center of the image. Results revealed that participants of every age looked more often at each face when it was more salient compared to less salient. In contrast, centering did not increase the likelihood that infants looked at a given face, but in later childhood and adulthood centering became a stronger cue for face looking. A control analysis determined that the age-related change in centering was specific to face looking; participants of all ages were more likely to look in the center of the image, and this center bias did not change with age. The implications for using videos in educational and diagnostic contexts are discussed.","How can researchers best measure infants' motor experiences in the home? Body position—whether infants are held, supine, prone, sitting, or upright—is an important developmental experience. However, the standard way of measuring infant body position, video recording by an experimenter in the home, can only capture short instances, may bias measurements, and conflicts with physical distancing guidelines resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we introduce and validate an alternative method that uses machine learning algorithms to classify infants' body position from a set of wearable inertial sensors. A laboratory study of 15 infants demonstrated that the method was sufficiently accurate to measure individual differences in the time that infants spent in each body position. Two case studies showed the feasibility of applying this method to testing infants in the home using a contactless equipment drop-off procedure.","How are eyes and head adapted to meet the demands of visual exploration in different tasks and environments? In two studies, we measured the horizontal movements of the eyes (using mobile eye tracking in Studies 1 and 2) and the head (using inertial sensors in Study 2) while participants completed a walking task and a search and retrieval task in a large, outdoor environment. We found that the spread of visual exploration was greater while searching compared with walking, and this was primarily driven by increased movement of the head as opposed to the eyes. The contributions of the head to gaze shifts of different eccentricities was greater when searching compared to when walking. Findings are discussed with respect to understanding visual exploration as a motor action with multiple degrees of freedom.","What makes a task hard or easy? The question seems easy, but answering it has been hard. The only consensus has been that, all else being equal, easy tasks can be performed by more individuals than hard tasks, and easy tasks are usually preferred over hard tasks. Feghhi and Rosenbaum (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 45, 983–994, 2019) asked whether task difficulty might reflect a single amodal quantity. Based on their subjects’ two-alternative forced-choice data from tasks involving choices of tasks with graded physical and mental challenges, the authors showed that the difficulty of passing through a narrow gap rather than a wide gap was psychologically equivalent to memorizing an extra .55 digits. In the present study, we extended this approach by adding new arguments for the hypothesis that task difficulty might reflect a single amodal quantity (inspired by considerations of physics, economics, and the common code hypothesis for the study of perception and action), and we tested narrower gaps than before to see whether we would find a larger equivalent memory-digit. Consistent with our prediction, we obtained a value of .95. We suggest that our multi-modal two-alternative forced-choice procedure can pave the way toward a better understanding of task difficulty.","Immersive virtual environments (VEs) are most useful for training and education when viewers perceive and act accurately within them. Judgments of action capabilities within a VE provide a good measure of perceptual fidelity — the notion of how closely perception and action in the VE match that in the real world — and can also assess how perception for action may be calibrated with visual feedback based on one’s own actions. In the current study we tested judg- ments of action capabilities within a VE for two different reaching behaviors: reaching out and reaching up. Our goal was to assess whether feedback from actual reaching improves judgments and if any recalibration due to feedback differed across reaching behaviors. We first measured participants’ actual reaching out and reaching up capabilities so that feedback trials could be scaled to their actual abil- ities. Participants then completed blocks of alternating perceptual adjustment and feedback trials. In adjustment trials, they adjusted a virtual target to a distance perceived to be just reachable. In feedback trials, they viewed targets that were farther or closer than their actual reach, decided whether the target was reachable, and then reached out to the target to receive visual feedback from a hand-held con- troller. The first feedback block manipulated the target distance to be 30% over or under actual reach and subsequent blocks decreased the deviation to 20%, 10% and 5% of actual reach. We found that for both reaching behaviors, reach was initially overestimated, and then perceptual estimations decreased to become more accurate over feed- back blocks. Accuracy in the feedback trials themselves showed that targets just beyond reach were more difficult to judge correctly. This study establishes a straightforward methodology that can be used for calibration of actions in VEs and has implications for applications that depend on accurate reaching within VEs.","Infants’ visual experiences are important for learning, and may depend on how information is structured in the visual field. This study examined how objects are distributed in 12-month-old infants’ field of view in a mobile play setting. Infants wore a mobile eye tracker that recorded their field of view and eye movements while they freely played with toys and a caregiver. We measured how centered and spread object locations were in infants’ field of view, and investigated how infant posture, object looking, and object distance affected the centering and spread. We found that far toys were less centered in infants’ field of view while infants were prone compared to when sitting or upright. Overall, toys became more centered in view and less spread in location when infants were looking at toys regardless of posture and toy distance. In sum, this study showed that infants’ visual experiences are shaped by the physical relation between infants’ bodies and the locations of objects in the world. However, infants are able to compensate for postural and environmental constraints by actively moving their head and eyes when choosing to look at an object.","Head-mounted eye tracking is a new method that allows researchers to catch a glimpse of what infants and children see during naturalistic activities. In this chapter, we review how mobile, wearable eye trackers improve the construct validity of important developmental constructs, such as visual object experiences and social attention, in ways that would be impossible using screen-based eye tracking. Head-mounted eye tracking improves ecological validity by allowing researchers to present more realistic and complex visual scenes, create more interactive experimental situations, and examine how the body influences what infants and children see. As with any new method, there are difficulties to overcome. Accordingly, we identify what aspects of head-mounted eye tracking study design affect the measurement quality, interpretability of the results, and efficiency of gathering data. Moreover, we provide a summary of best practices aimed at allowing researchers to make well-informed decisions about whether and how to apply head-mounted eye tracking to their own research questions.","Visual attention in complex, dynamic scenes is attracted to locations that contain socially relevant features, such as faces, and to areas that are visually salient. Previous work suggests that there is a global shift over development such that observers increasingly attend to faces with age. However, no prior work has tested whether this shift is truly global, that is, consistent across and within stimuli despite variations in content. To test the global shift hypothesis, we recorded eye movements of 89 children (6 months to 10 years) and adults while they viewed 7 video clips. We measured the extent to which each participant attended to faces and to salient areas for each video. There was no evidence of global age-related changes in attention: Neither feature showed consistent increases or decreases with age. Moreover, windowed analyses within each stimulus video revealed significant moment-to-moment variations in the relation between age and each visual feature (via a bootstrapping analysis). For some time windows, adults looked more often at both feature types compared to infants and children. However, for other time windows, the pattern was reversed—younger participants looked more at faces and salient locations. Lack of consistent directional effects provides strong evidence against the global shift hypothesis. We suggest an alternative explanation: Over development, observers increasingly prioritize when and where to look by learning to track which features are relevant within a scene. Implications for the development of visual attention and children’s understanding of screen-based media are discussed.","Visual exploratory behavior refers to actively gathering visual information through coordinated eye, head, and body movements—looking around with a purpose. In this article, I compare the study of visual exploration using stationary, screen-based tasks versus mobile, naturalistic tasks. In doing so, I discuss how the ecological validity of research depends on variations in three factors: visual characteristics of stimuli, the opportunity for participants to interact with their surroundings, and participants’ ability to move their bodies. In particular, the long-standing reliance on stationary, screen tasks has precluded progress in understanding the last factor—how anatomical, biomechanical, and physiological aspects of the body influence where observers look. I argue that each factor is vital to revealing the flexibility, adaptiveness, and efficiency of everyday visual exploration.","Prior work shows that the calibration of perception and action transfers between actions depending on their functional similarity: Practising (and thus calibrating perception of) one affordance will also calibrate perception for an affordance with a similar function but not for an affordance with a disparate function. We tested this hypothesis by measuring whether calibration transferred between two affordances for passing through openings: squeezing sideways through doorways without becoming stuck and fitting sideways through doorways while avoiding collision. Participants wore a backpack to alter affordances for passage and create a need for perceptual recalibration. Calibration failed to transfer between the two actions (e.g., practising squeezing through doorways calibrated perception of squeezing but not fitting). Differences between squeezing and fitting affordances that might have required different information for perception and recalibration are explored to understand why calibration did not transfer. In light of these results, we propose a revised hypothesis—calibration transfers between affordances on the basis of both functional and informational similarity.","The first goal of this article is to review recent advances in understanding how new motor skills facilitate infants’ exploration—the active acquisition of information about their environments. New postural abilities, such as sitting and walking, qualitatively change how infants can learn about objects, places, and people with potential downstream effects on infants’ later cognitive and linguistic development. What's missing, however, is a characterization of how new exploratory abilities change infants’ everyday experiences. Presumably, changes in opportunities for learning mediate the downstream effects of posture on other developmental achievements. Accordingly, the second goal of this article is to discuss the importance of measuring the ecology of infants’ everyday experiences and how they vary.","James J. Gibson dismissed studies of “looking at” for some reasons, each of which has been influential in guiding contemporary research on naturalistic looking with the eyes and head. However, Gibson recognized that stationary eye movement recording was insufficient to study whole-body visual exploration. Task influences on visual exploration are even more striking when observers are free to engage in everyday actions that involve movement. Maintaining awareness of the visual world can be thought of as the most basic “task” of visual exploration. Gibson emphasized that a nested visual system—the eyes within the head within the body—is coordinated to visually explore one’s surroundings. Moving the head is important for minimizing extreme eye movements, however, head movements themselves should also be minimized to make visual exploration efficient because head movements are effortful. Looking ahead, we must test how observers’ active visual exploration supports perception of a stable visual world.","Changes in the body over developmental time (e.g., physical growth) as well as over shorter timescales (e.g., wearing a backpack, carrying a large object) alter possibilities for motor action. How well can children recalibrate their perception of action possibilities to account for sudden changes to body size? The current study compared younger children (4–7 years), older children (8–11 years), and adults as they decided whether they could squeeze through doorways of varying widths. To test for age-related changes in recalibration to modified abilities versus perception of unmodified abilities, half of the participants wore a backpack while making judgments and squeezing through doorways and half did not. Results indicated that judgment accuracy improved with age but that participants had more difficulty when recalibrating to modified abilities. Bias in decision making also changed with age; whereas younger children made riskier decisions by attempting to fit through impossibly small doorways, older children were more cautious. Some particularly cautious participants never generated practice feedback by attempting (and failing) to fit through smaller doorways, which prevented them from recalibrating. Taken together with previous literature, the results of the current study suggest that the development of perception for unmodified versus modified ability proceeds at different rates and depends on the particular motor task.","Developmental theories depend on characterizing the input to potential learning mechanisms—infants’ everyday experiences. The current study employed a novel ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to measure two aspects of the physical context of those experiences: body position and location. Infant body position was selected because it relates to the development of a variety of other skills. Caregivers of 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month-olds reported infants’ body position—held, supine, reclined, prone, sitting, or upright—in response to text message notifications over a week to capture infants’ experiences across the entire range of their daily activities. Findings revealed a tremendous disparity in the distribution of body position experiences over the first year. Younger infants spend more time held, supine, and reclined, whereas older infants spend more time sitting and upright. Body position experiences differed substantially between same-age infants who possess a motor skill (e.g., ability to sit or walk) compared with those who did not, suggesting that developing motor skills change infants’ everyday experiences. Finally, the success of the methodology suggests that similar EMAs might be used to study a wide range of infants’ naturalistic experiences.","When motor abilities change, people need to generate information to recalibrate their perception through active exploration. Most prior research has focused on observers’ ability to update perception by executing experimenter-specified exploratory behaviors, however, the question of how observers spontaneously choose how to explore has been overlooked. We asked how effectively adults decide to explore when adapting to changes in their ability to squeeze through doorways. Results revealed that participants made efficient decisions about when to explore by approaching and practicing—they most often explored doorways that were near the limit of their abilities, and participants explored less often as their perceptual calibration improved. However, participants made sub-optimal decisions about how to explore, which resulted in a failure to fully recalibrate. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the processes of perceptual-motor recalibration that underlie real-world behavior.","Recalibration of affordance perception in response to changing motor abilities can only occur if observers detect appropriate perceptual information. Recent work suggests that although many affordances can be recalibrated without practicing the specific action to gather outcome feedback—information about whether the attempted action succeeded or failed—calibration of other affordances might depend on outcome feedback (Franchak, Attent Percept Psychophys 79:1816–1829, 2017). However, past work could not rule out the possibility that practicing the action produced perceptual–motor feedback besides outcome feedback that facilitated recalibration. The results of two experiments support the hypothesis that recalibration in a doorway squeezing task depends on outcome feedback as opposed to perceptual–motor feedback. After putting on a backpack that changed participants’ doorway squeezing ability, affordance judgments were uncalibrated and remained so even after making repeated judgments. However, after practicing the action, which produced outcome feedback, judgments rapidly calibrated. Moreover, the order of feedback information directly impacted participants’ judgments: Participants did not recalibrate if they received only success experience or only failure experience. Recalibration only occurred after participants received both types of feedback experiences, suggesting that outcome feedback is necessary for recalibration in the doorway squeezing task. More generally, the results of the current study support a key tenet of ecological psychology—that affordance perception depends on action-specific information about body–environment relations.","Face-to-face interaction between infants and their caregivers is a mainstay of developmental research. However, common laboratory paradigms for studying dyadic interaction oversimplify the act of looking at the partner's face by seating infants and caregivers face to face in stationary positions. In less constrained conditions when both partners are freely mobile, infants and caregivers must move their heads and bodies to look at each other. We hypothesized that face looking and mutual gaze for each member of the dyad would decrease with increased motor costs of looking. To test this hypothesis, 12-month-old crawling and walking infants and their parents wore head-mounted eye trackers to record eye movements of each member of the dyad during locomotor free play in a large toy-filled playroom. Findings revealed that increased motor costs decreased face looking and mutual gaze: Each partner looked less at the other's face when their own posture or the other's posture required more motor effort to gain visual access to the other's face. Caregivers mirrored infants' posture by spending more time down on the ground when infants were prone, perhaps to facilitate face looking. Infants looked more at toys than at their caregiver's face, but caregivers looked at their infant's face and at toys in equal amounts. Furthermore, infants looked less at toys and faces compared to studies that used stationary tasks, suggesting that the attentional demands differ in an unconstrained locomotor task. Taken together, findings indicate that ever-changing motor constraints affect real-life social looking.","Young children's visual environments are dynamic, changing moment-by-moment as children physically and visually explore spaces and objects and interact with people around them. Head-mounted eye tracking offers a unique opportunity to capture children's dynamic egocentric views and how they allocate visual attention within those views. This protocol provides guiding principles and practical recommendations for researchers using head-mounted eye trackers in both laboratory and more naturalistic settings. Head-mounted eye tracking complements other experimental methods by enhancing opportunities for data collection in more ecologically valid contexts through increased portability and freedom of head and body movements compared to screen-based eye tracking. This protocol can also be integrated with other technologies, such as motion tracking and heart-rate monitoring, to provide a high-density multimodal dataset for examining natural behavior, learning, and development than previously possible. This paper illustrates the types of data generated from head-mounted eye tracking in a study designed to investigate visual attention in one natural context for toddlers: free-flowing toy play with a parent. Successful use of this protocol will allow researchers to collect data that can be used to answer questions not only about visual attention, but also about a broad range of other perceptual, cognitive, and social skills and their development.","Infants’ eye movements provide a rich source of information. Measuring real time visual selection, where infants choose to look, can inform on skill level and psychological processes in perceptual, cognitive, social, and language tasks. The accumulation of visual experiences over development is also of psychological interest. How often infants see different visual stimuli may relate to rates of learning in a variety of domains. Many developmental studies employ remote eye trackers: High-speed cameras record infants’ eye movements while they sit and watch stimuli displayed on a computer monitor (Aslin, 2011). Remote eye tracking is appropriate for studying visual selection in tasks that require precise control over the stimuli. However, studying eye movements in controlled, laboratory contexts cannot adequately inform on infants’ visual selection in natural tasks or during their everyday visual experiences over development. In the real world, infants select what they see and they do so while mobile. Accordingly, understanding infants’ vision in real world tasks requires measuring eye movements from infants’ first-person view as they walk, crawl, reach, and play.","Recalibration of affordance perception allows observers to adapt to changes in the body’s size or abilities that alter possibilities for action. Of key interest is understanding how exploratory behaviors lead to successful recalibration. The present study was designed to test a novel hypothesis—that the same processes of exploration and recalibration should generalize between affordances that share a similar function. Most affordances for fitting the body through openings are recalibrated without feedback from practicing the action; locomotion exploration is sufficient. The present study used a different fitting task, squeezing through doorways, to determine whether locomotor experience was sufficient for recalibrating to changes in body size that altered affordances. Participants were unable to recalibrate from locomotor experience, demonstrating that exploratory behaviors do not necessarily generalize between functionally similar affordances. Participants only recalibrated following action practice or after receiving feedback about judgment accuracy, suggesting that the informational requirements of the squeezing task may differ from those of other fitting tasks. Implications for affordance theory are discussed.","This article reviews research on the development of motor behavior from a developmental systems perspective. We focus on infancy when basic action systems are acquired. Posture provides a stable base for locomotion, manual actions, and facial actions. Experience facilitates improvements in motor behavior and infants accumulate immense amounts of experience with all of their basic action systems. At every point in development, perception guides motor behavior by providing feedback about the results of just prior movements and information about what to do next. Reciprocally, the development of motor behavior provides fodder for perception. More generally, motor development brings about new opportunities for acquiring knowledge about the world, and burgeoning motor skills can instigate cascades of developmental changes in perceptual, cognitive, and social domains.","The current study investigated age differences in free viewing gaze behavior. Adults and 6-, 9-, 12-, and 24-month-old infants watched a 60-sec Sesame Street video clip while their eye movements were recorded. Adults displayed high intersubject consistency in eye movements; they tended to fixate the same places at the same. Infants showed weaker consistency between observers and intersubject consistency increased with age. Across age groups, the influence of both bottom-up features (fixating visually salient areas) and top-down features (looking at faces) increased. Moreover, individual differences in fixating bottom-up and top-down features predicted whether infants’ eye movements were consistent with those of adults, even when controlling for age. However, this relation was moderated by the number of faces available in the scene, suggesting that the development of adult-like viewing involves learning when to prioritize looking at bottom-up and top-down features.","The current study investigated eye-hand coordination in natural reaching. We asked whether the speed of reaching related to the quality of visual information obtained by young children and adults. Participants played with objects on a table while their eye and hand movements were recorded. We developed new techniques to find reaching events in natural activity and to determine how closely participants aligned gaze to objects while reaching. Reaching speed and eye alignment were related for adults but not for children. These results suggest that adults but not children adapt reaching movements according to the quality of visual information (or vice-versa) during natural activity. We discuss possibilities for why this coordination was not observed in children.","Global visual processing is important for segmenting scenes, extracting form from background, and recognizing objects. Local processing involves attention to the local elements, contrast, and boundaries of an image at the expense of extracting a global percept. Previous work is inconclusive regarding the relative development of local and global processing. Some studies suggest that global perception is already present by 8 months of age, whereas others suggest that the ability arises during childhood and continues to develop during adolescence. We used a novel method to assess the development of global processing in 3- to 10-year-old children and an adult comparison group. We used Kanizsa illusory contours as an assay of global perception and measured responses on a touch-sensitive screen while monitoring eye position with a head-mounted eye tracker. Participants were tested using a similarity match-to-sample paradigm. Using converging measures, we found a clear developmental progression with age such that the youngest children performed near chance on the illusory contour discrimination, whereas 7- and 8-year-olds performed nearly perfectly, as did adults. There was clear evidence of a gradual shift from a local processing strategy to a global one; young children looked predominantly at and touched the “pacman” inducers of the illusory form, whereas older children and adults looked predominantly at and touched the middle of the form. These data show a prolonged developmental trajectory in appreciation of global form, with a transition from local to global visual processing between 4 and 7 years of age.","Possibilities for action depend on the fit between the body and the environment. Perceiving what actions are possible is challenging, because the body and the environment are always changing. How do people adapt to changes in body size and compression? In Experiment 1, we tested pregnant women monthly over the course of pregnancy to determine whether they adapted to changing possibilities for squeezing through doorways. As women gained belly girth and weight, previously passable doorways were no longer passable, but women’s decisions to attempt passage tracked their changing abilities. Moreover, their accuracy was equivalent to that of nonpregnant adults. In Experiment 2, nonpregnant adults wore a “pregnancy pack” that instantly increased the size of their bellies, and they judged whether doorways were passable. Accuracy in the “pregnant” participants was only marginally worse than that of actual pregnant women, suggesting that participants adapted to the prosthesis during the test session. In Experiment 3, participants wore the pregnancy pack and gauged passability before and after attempting passage. The judgments were grossly inaccurate prior to receiving feedback. These findings indicate that experience facilitates perceptual–motor recalibration for certain types of actions.","We propose a new way to describe affordances for action. Previous characterizations of affordances treat action possibilities as binary categories—either possible or impossible—separated by a critical point. Here, we show that affordances are probabilistic functions, thus accounting for variability in motor performance. By measuring an affordance function, researchers can describe the likelihood of success for every unit of the environment. We demonstrate how to fit an affordance function to performance data using established psychophysical procedures and illustrate how the threshold and variability parameters describe different possibilities for action. Finally, we discuss the implications of probabilistic affordances for development, perception, and decision making.","How does visual experience change over development? To investigate changes in visual input over the developmental transition from crawling to walking, thirty 13‐month‐olds crawled or walked down a straight path wearing a head‐mounted eye tracker that recorded gaze direction and head‐centered field of view. Thirteen additional infants wore a motion tracker that recorded head orientation. Compared to walkers, crawlers' field of view contained less walls and more floor. Walkers directed gaze straight ahead at caregivers, whereas crawlers looked down at the floor. Crawlers obtained visual information about targets at higher elevations—caregivers and toys—by craning their heads upward and sitting up to bring the room into view. Findings indicate that visual experiences are intimately tied to infants' posture.","Understanding visual attention in children could yield insight into how the visual system develops during formative years and how children’s overt attention plays a role in development and learning. We are particularly interested in the role of hands and hand activities in children’s visual attention. We use headmounted cameras to collect egocentric video and eye gaze data of toddlers during playful social interaction with their parents, and developed a computer vision system to track and label different hands within the child’s field of view. We report detailed results on appearance frequencies and spatial distributions of parents’ and children’s hands both in the child’s field of view and as the target of the child’s attentional fixation.","Egocentric cameras are becoming more popular, introducing increasing volumes of video in which the biases and framing of traditional photography are replaced with those of natural viewing tendencies. This paradigm enables new applications, including novel studies of social interaction and human development. Recent work has focused on identifying the camera wearer's hands as a first step towards more complex analysis. In this paper, we study how to disambiguate and track not only the observer's hands but also those of social partners. We present a probabilistic framework for modeling paired interactions that incorporates the spatial, temporal, and appearance constraints inherent in egocentric video. We test our approach on a dataset of over 30 minutes of video from six pairs of subjects.","Perceiving possibilities for action—affordances—requires sensitivity, accuracy, and consistency. In the current study, we tested children of different ages (16-month-olds to 7-year-olds) and adults to examine the development of affordance perception for reaching through openings of various sizes. Using a psychophysical procedure, we estimated individual affordance functions to characterize participants’ actual ability to fit their hand through openings and individual decision functions to characterize attempts to reach. Decisions were less accurate in younger children (16-month-olds to 5-year-olds); they were more likely to attempt impossible openings and to touch openings prior to refusing, suggesting a slow developmental trend in learning to perceive affordances for fitting through openings. However, analyses of multiple outcome measures revealed that the youngest participants were equally consistent in their decision making as the oldest ones and that every age group showed sensitivity to changes in the environment by scaling their attempts to opening size.","The current study investigated whether younger (college-age) and older adults (60+ years) differ in their ability to perceive safe and unsafe motor actions. Participants decided whether to walk through openings varying in width in two penalty conditions: In the doorway condition, if participants attempted to squeeze through impossibly narrow openings, the penalty for error was entrapment. In the ledge condition, if participants attempted to inch along impossibly narrow ledges, the penalty for error was falling. Results showed that across the lifespan, people consider falling to be a more severe penalty than getting stuck: Both younger and older adults made more conservative decisions when the penalty for error was falling, and older women were especially leery of falling. In both age groups, abilities and decisions were based on dynamic properties of the body, such as compressed body size in the doorway condition and balance in the ledge condition. Findings indicate that failure to perceive possibilities for action is unlikely to be the cause of the increased prevalence of falling in older adults.","What infants decide to do does not necessarily reflect the extent of what they know. In the current study, 17-month-olds were encouraged to walk through openings of varying width under risk of entrapment. Infants erred by squeezing into openings that were too small and became stuck, suggesting that they did not accurately perceive whether they could fit. However, a second penalty condition revealed accurate action selection when errors resulted in falling, indicating that infants are indeed perceptually sensitive to fitting through openings. Furthermore, independent measures of perception were equivalent between the two penalty conditions, suggesting that differences in action selection resulted from different penalties, not lack of perceptual sensitivity.","Walkers need to modify their ongoing actions to meet the demands of everyday environments. Navigating through openings requires gait modifications if the size of the opening is too small relative to the body. Here we ask whether the spatial requirements for navigating horizontal and vertical openings differ, and, if so, whether walkers are sensitive to those requirements. To test walkers’ sensitivity to demands for gait modification, we asked participants to judge whether they could walk through horizontal openings without shoulder rotation and through vertical openings without ducking. Afterward, participants walked through the openings, so that we could determine which opening sizes elicited gait modifications. Participants turned their shoulders with more space available than the space they left themselves for ducking. Larger buffers for horizontal openings may reflect different spatial requirements created by lateral sway of the body during walking compared to vertical bounce. In addition, greater variability of turning from trial to trial compared with ducking may lead walkers to adopt a more conservative buffer to avoid errors. Verbal judgments accurately predicted whether openings required gait modifications. For horizontal openings, participants’ judgments were best predicted by the body’s dynamic abilities, not static shoulder width. The differences between horizontal and vertical openings illustrate that walkers account for the dynamic properties of walking in addition to scaling decisions to body dimensions.","Understanding the development of mature motion processing may require knowledge about the statistics of the visual input that infants are exposed to, how these change across development, and how they influence the maturation of motion-sensitive brain networks. Here we develop a set of techniques to study the optic flow experienced by infants and mothers during locomotion as a first step toward a broader analysis of the statistics of the natural visual environment during development.","Despite hundreds of studies describing infants’ visual exploration of experimental stimuli, researchers know little about where infants look during everyday interactions. The current study describes the first method for studying visual behavior during natural interactions in mobile infants. Six 14-month-old infants wore a head-mounted eye-tracker that recorded gaze during free play with mothers. Results revealed that infants’ visual exploration is opportunistic and depends on the availability of information and the constraints of infants’ own bodies. Looks to mothers’ faces were rare following infant-directed utterances but more likely if mothers were sitting at infants’ eye level. Gaze toward the destination of infants’ hand movements was common during manual actions and crawling, but looks toward obstacles during leg movements were less frequent.","We investigated the effect of action performance on perceptual judgments by evaluating accuracy in judging whether doorways allowed passage. Participants made judgments either before or after walking through doorways of varying widths. Participants in the action-first group benefited from action feedback and made more accurate judgments compared to a perception-first group that judged doorways before walking through them. Action feedback aided perceptual judgments by facilitating scaling to body dimensions: Judgments in the action-first group were strongly related to height, weight, and torso size, whereas judgments in the perception-first group were not.","The current study showed that visual fixation of obstacles is not required for rapid and adaptive navigation of obstacles. Children and adults wore a wireless, head-mounted eye-tracker during a visual search task in a room cluttered with obstacles. They spontaneously walked, jumped, and ran through the room, stepping up, down, and over obstacles. Both children and adults navigated adaptively without fixating obstacles, however, adults fixated less often than children. We discuss several possibilities for why obstacle navigation may shift from foveal to peripheral control over development.","Currently, developmental psychologists rely on paradigms that use infants' looking behavior as the primary measure. Despite hundreds of studies describing infants' visual exploration of experimental stimuli, researchers know little about where infants look during everyday interactions. Head-mounted eye-trackers have provided many insights into natural vision in adults, but methods and equipment that work well with adults are not suitable for infants---the equipment is prohibitively big and calibration procedures too demanding. We outline the first method for studying mobile infants' visual behavior during natural interactions. We used a new, specially designed head-mounted eye-tracker to record 6 infants' gaze as they played with mothers in a room full of toys and obstacles. Using this method, we measured how infants employed gaze while navigating obstacles, manipulating objects, and interacting with mothers. Results revealed new insights into visually guided locomotor and manual action and social interaction.","This chapter has two major aims. The first is to describe flexibility in motor action. Balance and locomotion in infants are used as a test case for understanding three aspects of behavioral flexibility—adaptive motor decisions, modification of ongoing activity, and new means to achieve a goal. The second aim is to illuminate the links between flexibility and development. In particular, it demonstrates that flexibility is acquired during development and that developmental changes both facilitate and impede its acquisition. It is shown that flexibility does not automatically appear when infants acquire new forms of balance and locomotion. Instead, flexibility is learned over many weeks of everyday locomotor experience in a newly acquired posture. Infants learn how to learn as they acquire the appropriate exploratory behaviors for generating information about the current constraints on action and potential alternatives for achieving their goals. Two kinds of limits on flexibility are described—one created by developmental transitions to new postural control systems and the other created by the nature of the perceptual information for friction and rigidity."],"authors":["Franchak, J.M., & Kadooka, K.","Franchak, J.M., Scott, V., & Luo, C.","Franchak, J.M., McGee, B., & Blanch, G.","Feghhi, I., Franchak, J.M., & Rosenbaum.

We report a secondary analysis of Kadooka and Franchak (2020), in which observers’ eye movements were recorded during viewing of television clips containing a variety of faces. For every face on every video frame, we calculated its visual saliency (based on both static and dynamic image features) and calculated how close the face was to the center of the image. Results revealed that participants of every age looked more often at each face when it was more salient compared to less salient. In contrast, centering did not increase the likelihood that infants looked at a given face, but in later childhood and adulthood centering became a stronger cue for face looking. A control analysis determined that the age-related change in centering was specific to face looking; participants of all ages were more likely to look in the center of the image, and this center bias did not change with age. The implications for using videos in educational and diagnostic contexts are discussed.","Abstract:  How can researchers best measure infants' motor experiences in the home? Body position—whether infants are held, supine, prone, sitting, or upright—is an important developmental experience. However, the standard way of measuring infant body position, video recording by an experimenter in the home, can only capture short instances, may bias measurements, and conflicts with physical distancing guidelines resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we introduce and validate an alternative method that uses machine learning algorithms to classify infants' body position from a set of wearable inertial sensors. A laboratory study of 15 infants demonstrated that the method was sufficiently accurate to measure individual differences in the time that infants spent in each body position. Two case studies showed the feasibility of applying this method to testing infants in the home using a contactless equipment drop-off procedure.","Abstract:  How are eyes and head adapted to meet the demands of visual exploration in different tasks and environments? In two studies, we measured the horizontal movements of the eyes (using mobile eye tracking in Studies 1 and 2) and the head (using inertial sensors in Study 2) while participants completed a walking task and a search and retrieval task in a large, outdoor environment. We found that the spread of visual exploration was greater while searching compared with walking, and this was primarily driven by increased movement of the head as opposed to the eyes. The contributions of the head to gaze shifts of different eccentricities was greater when searching compared to when walking. Findings are discussed with respect to understanding visual exploration as a motor action with multiple degrees of freedom.","Abstract:  What makes a task hard or easy? The question seems easy, but answering it has been hard. The only consensus has been that, all else being equal, easy tasks can be performed by more individuals than hard tasks, and easy tasks are usually preferred over hard tasks. Feghhi and Rosenbaum (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 45, 983–994, 2019) asked whether task difficulty might reflect a single amodal quantity. Based on their subjects’ two-alternative forced-choice data from tasks involving choices of tasks with graded physical and mental challenges, the authors showed that the difficulty of passing through a narrow gap rather than a wide gap was psychologically equivalent to memorizing an extra .55 digits. In the present study, we extended this approach by adding new arguments for the hypothesis that task difficulty might reflect a single amodal quantity (inspired by considerations of physics, economics, and the common code hypothesis for the study of perception and action), and we tested narrower gaps than before to see whether we would find a larger equivalent memory-digit. Consistent with our prediction, we obtained a value of .95. We suggest that our multi-modal two-alternative forced-choice procedure can pave the way toward a better understanding of task difficulty.","Abstract:  Immersive virtual environments (VEs) are most useful for training and education when viewers perceive and act accurately within them. Judgments of action capabilities within a VE provide a good measure of perceptual fidelity — the notion of how closely perception and action in the VE match that in the real world — and can also assess how perception for action may be calibrated with visual feedback based on one’s own actions. In the current study we tested judg- ments of action capabilities within a VE for two different reaching behaviors: reaching out and reaching up. Our goal was to assess whether feedback from actual reaching improves judgments and if any recalibration due to feedback differed across reaching behaviors. We first measured participants’ actual reaching out and reaching up capabilities so that feedback trials could be scaled to their actual abil- ities. Participants then completed blocks of alternating perceptual adjustment and feedback trials. In adjustment trials, they adjusted a virtual target to a distance perceived to be just reachable. In feedback trials, they viewed targets that were farther or closer than their actual reach, decided whether the target was reachable, and then reached out to the target to receive visual feedback from a hand-held con- troller. The first feedback block manipulated the target distance to be 30% over or under actual reach and subsequent blocks decreased the deviation to 20%, 10% and 5% of actual reach. We found that for both reaching behaviors, reach was initially overestimated, and then perceptual estimations decreased to become more accurate over feed- back blocks. Accuracy in the feedback trials themselves showed that targets just beyond reach were more difficult to judge correctly. This study establishes a straightforward methodology that can be used for calibration of actions in VEs and has implications for applications that depend on accurate reaching within VEs.","Abstract:  Infants’ visual experiences are important for learning, and may depend on how information is structured in the visual field. This study examined how objects are distributed in 12-month-old infants’ field of view in a mobile play setting. Infants wore a mobile eye tracker that recorded their field of view and eye movements while they freely played with toys and a caregiver. We measured how centered and spread object locations were in infants’ field of view, and investigated how infant posture, object looking, and object distance affected the centering and spread. We found that far toys were less centered in infants’ field of view while infants were prone compared to when sitting or upright. Overall, toys became more centered in view and less spread in location when infants were looking at toys regardless of posture and toy distance. In sum, this study showed that infants’ visual experiences are shaped by the physical relation between infants’ bodies and the locations of objects in the world. However, infants are able to compensate for postural and environmental constraints by actively moving their head and eyes when choosing to look at an object.","Abstract:  Head-mounted eye tracking is a new method that allows researchers to catch a glimpse of what infants and children see during naturalistic activities. In this chapter, we review how mobile, wearable eye trackers improve the construct validity of important developmental constructs, such as visual object experiences and social attention, in ways that would be impossible using screen-based eye tracking. Head-mounted eye tracking improves ecological validity by allowing researchers to present more realistic and complex visual scenes, create more interactive experimental situations, and examine how the body influences what infants and children see. As with any new method, there are difficulties to overcome. Accordingly, we identify what aspects of head-mounted eye tracking study design affect the measurement quality, interpretability of the results, and efficiency of gathering data. Moreover, we provide a summary of best practices aimed at allowing researchers to make well-informed decisions about whether and how to apply head-mounted eye tracking to their own research questions.","Abstract:  Visual attention in complex, dynamic scenes is attracted to locations that contain socially relevant features, such as faces, and to areas that are visually salient. Previous work suggests that there is a global shift over development such that observers increasingly attend to faces with age. However, no prior work has tested whether this shift is truly global, that is, consistent across and within stimuli despite variations in content. To test the global shift hypothesis, we recorded eye movements of 89 children (6 months to 10 years) and adults while they viewed 7 video clips. We measured the extent to which each participant attended to faces and to salient areas for each video. There was no evidence of global age-related changes in attention: Neither feature showed consistent increases or decreases with age. Moreover, windowed analyses within each stimulus video revealed significant moment-to-moment variations in the relation between age and each visual feature (via a bootstrapping analysis). For some time windows, adults looked more often at both feature types compared to infants and children. However, for other time windows, the pattern was reversed—younger participants looked more at faces and salient locations. Lack of consistent directional effects provides strong evidence against the global shift hypothesis. We suggest an alternative explanation: Over development, observers increasingly prioritize when and where to look by learning to track which features are relevant within a scene. Implications for the development of visual attention and children’s understanding of screen-based media are discussed.","Abstract:  Visual exploratory behavior refers to actively gathering visual information through coordinated eye, head, and body movements—looking around with a purpose. In this article, I compare the study of visual exploration using stationary, screen-based tasks versus mobile, naturalistic tasks. In doing so, I discuss how the ecological validity of research depends on variations in three factors: visual characteristics of stimuli, the opportunity for participants to interact with their surroundings, and participants’ ability to move their bodies. In particular, the long-standing reliance on stationary, screen tasks has precluded progress in understanding the last factor—how anatomical, biomechanical, and physiological aspects of the body influence where observers look. I argue that each factor is vital to revealing the flexibility, adaptiveness, and efficiency of everyday visual exploration.","Abstract:  Prior work shows that the calibration of perception and action transfers between actions depending on their functional similarity: Practising (and thus calibrating perception of) one affordance will also calibrate perception for an affordance with a similar function but not for an affordance with a disparate function. We tested this hypothesis by measuring whether calibration transferred between two affordances for passing through openings: squeezing sideways through doorways without becoming stuck and fitting sideways through doorways while avoiding collision. Participants wore a backpack to alter affordances for passage and create a need for perceptual recalibration. Calibration failed to transfer between the two actions (e.g., practising squeezing through doorways calibrated perception of squeezing but not fitting). Differences between squeezing and fitting affordances that might have required different information for perception and recalibration are explored to understand why calibration did not transfer. In light of these results, we propose a revised hypothesis—calibration transfers between affordances on the basis of both functional and informational similarity.","Abstract:  The first goal of this article is to review recent advances in understanding how new motor skills facilitate infants’ exploration—the active acquisition of information about their environments. New postural abilities, such as sitting and walking, qualitatively change how infants can learn about objects, places, and people with potential downstream effects on infants’ later cognitive and linguistic development. What's missing, however, is a characterization of how new exploratory abilities change infants’ everyday experiences. Presumably, changes in opportunities for learning mediate the downstream effects of posture on other developmental achievements. Accordingly, the second goal of this article is to discuss the importance of measuring the ecology of infants’ everyday experiences and how they vary.","Abstract:  James J. Gibson dismissed studies of “looking at” for some reasons, each of which has been influential in guiding contemporary research on naturalistic looking with the eyes and head. However, Gibson recognized that stationary eye movement recording was insufficient to study whole-body visual exploration. Task influences on visual exploration are even more striking when observers are free to engage in everyday actions that involve movement. Maintaining awareness of the visual world can be thought of as the most basic “task” of visual exploration. Gibson emphasized that a nested visual system—the eyes within the head within the body—is coordinated to visually explore one’s surroundings. Moving the head is important for minimizing extreme eye movements, however, head movements themselves should also be minimized to make visual exploration efficient because head movements are effortful. Looking ahead, we must test how observers’ active visual exploration supports perception of a stable visual world.","Abstract:  Changes in the body over developmental time (e.g., physical growth) as well as over shorter timescales (e.g., wearing a backpack, carrying a large object) alter possibilities for motor action. How well can children recalibrate their perception of action possibilities to account for sudden changes to body size? The current study compared younger children (4–7 years), older children (8–11 years), and adults as they decided whether they could squeeze through doorways of varying widths. To test for age-related changes in recalibration to modified abilities versus perception of unmodified abilities, half of the participants wore a backpack while making judgments and squeezing through doorways and half did not. Results indicated that judgment accuracy improved with age but that participants had more difficulty when recalibrating to modified abilities. Bias in decision making also changed with age; whereas younger children made riskier decisions by attempting to fit through impossibly small doorways, older children were more cautious. Some particularly cautious participants never generated practice feedback by attempting (and failing) to fit through smaller doorways, which prevented them from recalibrating. Taken together with previous literature, the results of the current study suggest that the development of perception for unmodified versus modified ability proceeds at different rates and depends on the particular motor task.","Abstract:  Developmental theories depend on characterizing the input to potential learning mechanisms—infants’ everyday experiences. The current study employed a novel ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to measure two aspects of the physical context of those experiences: body position and location. Infant body position was selected because it relates to the development of a variety of other skills. Caregivers of 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month-olds reported infants’ body position—held, supine, reclined, prone, sitting, or upright—in response to text message notifications over a week to capture infants’ experiences across the entire range of their daily activities. Findings revealed a tremendous disparity in the distribution of body position experiences over the first year. Younger infants spend more time held, supine, and reclined, whereas older infants spend more time sitting and upright. Body position experiences differed substantially between same-age infants who possess a motor skill (e.g., ability to sit or walk) compared with those who did not, suggesting that developing motor skills change infants’ everyday experiences. Finally, the success of the methodology suggests that similar EMAs might be used to study a wide range of infants’ naturalistic experiences.","Abstract:  When motor abilities change, people need to generate information to recalibrate their perception through active exploration. Most prior research has focused on observers’ ability to update perception by executing experimenter-specified exploratory behaviors, however, the question of how observers spontaneously choose how to explore has been overlooked. We asked how effectively adults decide to explore when adapting to changes in their ability to squeeze through doorways. Results revealed that participants made efficient decisions about when to explore by approaching and practicing—they most often explored doorways that were near the limit of their abilities, and participants explored less often as their perceptual calibration improved. However, participants made sub-optimal decisions about how to explore, which resulted in a failure to fully recalibrate. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the processes of perceptual-motor recalibration that underlie real-world behavior.","Abstract:  Recalibration of affordance perception in response to changing motor abilities can only occur if observers detect appropriate perceptual information. Recent work suggests that although many affordances can be recalibrated without practicing the specific action to gather outcome feedback—information about whether the attempted action succeeded or failed—calibration of other affordances might depend on outcome feedback (Franchak, Attent Percept Psychophys 79:1816–1829, 2017). However, past work could not rule out the possibility that practicing the action produced perceptual–motor feedback besides outcome feedback that facilitated recalibration. The results of two experiments support the hypothesis that recalibration in a doorway squeezing task depends on outcome feedback as opposed to perceptual–motor feedback. After putting on a backpack that changed participants’ doorway squeezing ability, affordance judgments were uncalibrated and remained so even after making repeated judgments. However, after practicing the action, which produced outcome feedback, judgments rapidly calibrated. Moreover, the order of feedback information directly impacted participants’ judgments: Participants did not recalibrate if they received only success experience or only failure experience. Recalibration only occurred after participants received both types of feedback experiences, suggesting that outcome feedback is necessary for recalibration in the doorway squeezing task. More generally, the results of the current study support a key tenet of ecological psychology—that affordance perception depends on action-specific information about body–environment relations.","Abstract:  Face-to-face interaction between infants and their caregivers is a mainstay of developmental research. However, common laboratory paradigms for studying dyadic interaction oversimplify the act of looking at the partner's face by seating infants and caregivers face to face in stationary positions. In less constrained conditions when both partners are freely mobile, infants and caregivers must move their heads and bodies to look at each other. We hypothesized that face looking and mutual gaze for each member of the dyad would decrease with increased motor costs of looking. To test this hypothesis, 12-month-old crawling and walking infants and their parents wore head-mounted eye trackers to record eye movements of each member of the dyad during locomotor free play in a large toy-filled playroom. Findings revealed that increased motor costs decreased face looking and mutual gaze: Each partner looked less at the other's face when their own posture or the other's posture required more motor effort to gain visual access to the other's face. Caregivers mirrored infants' posture by spending more time down on the ground when infants were prone, perhaps to facilitate face looking. Infants looked more at toys than at their caregiver's face, but caregivers looked at their infant's face and at toys in equal amounts. Furthermore, infants looked less at toys and faces compared to studies that used stationary tasks, suggesting that the attentional demands differ in an unconstrained locomotor task. Taken together, findings indicate that ever-changing motor constraints affect real-life social looking.","Abstract:  Young children's visual environments are dynamic, changing moment-by-moment as children physically and visually explore spaces and objects and interact with people around them. Head-mounted eye tracking offers a unique opportunity to capture children's dynamic egocentric views and how they allocate visual attention within those views. This protocol provides guiding principles and practical recommendations for researchers using head-mounted eye trackers in both laboratory and more naturalistic settings. Head-mounted eye tracking complements other experimental methods by enhancing opportunities for data collection in more ecologically valid contexts through increased portability and freedom of head and body movements compared to screen-based eye tracking. This protocol can also be integrated with other technologies, such as motion tracking and heart-rate monitoring, to provide a high-density multimodal dataset for examining natural behavior, learning, and development than previously possible. This paper illustrates the types of data generated from head-mounted eye tracking in a study designed to investigate visual attention in one natural context for toddlers: free-flowing toy play with a parent. Successful use of this protocol will allow researchers to collect data that can be used to answer questions not only about visual attention, but also about a broad range of other perceptual, cognitive, and social skills and their development.","Abstract:  Infants’ eye movements provide a rich source of information. Measuring real time visual selection, where infants choose to look, can inform on skill level and psychological processes in perceptual, cognitive, social, and language tasks. The accumulation of visual experiences over development is also of psychological interest. How often infants see different visual stimuli may relate to rates of learning in a variety of domains. Many developmental studies employ remote eye trackers: High-speed cameras record infants’ eye movements while they sit and watch stimuli displayed on a computer monitor (Aslin, 2011). Remote eye tracking is appropriate for studying visual selection in tasks that require precise control over the stimuli. However, studying eye movements in controlled, laboratory contexts cannot adequately inform on infants’ visual selection in natural tasks or during their everyday visual experiences over development. In the real world, infants select what they see and they do so while mobile. Accordingly, understanding infants’ vision in real world tasks requires measuring eye movements from infants’ first-person view as they walk, crawl, reach, and play.","Abstract:  Recalibration of affordance perception allows observers to adapt to changes in the body’s size or abilities that alter possibilities for action. Of key interest is understanding how exploratory behaviors lead to successful recalibration. The present study was designed to test a novel hypothesis—that the same processes of exploration and recalibration should generalize between affordances that share a similar function. Most affordances for fitting the body through openings are recalibrated without feedback from practicing the action; locomotion exploration is sufficient. The present study used a different fitting task, squeezing through doorways, to determine whether locomotor experience was sufficient for recalibrating to changes in body size that altered affordances. Participants were unable to recalibrate from locomotor experience, demonstrating that exploratory behaviors do not necessarily generalize between functionally similar affordances. Participants only recalibrated following action practice or after receiving feedback about judgment accuracy, suggesting that the informational requirements of the squeezing task may differ from those of other fitting tasks. Implications for affordance theory are discussed.","Abstract:  This article reviews research on the development of motor behavior from a developmental systems perspective. We focus on infancy when basic action systems are acquired. Posture provides a stable base for locomotion, manual actions, and facial actions. Experience facilitates improvements in motor behavior and infants accumulate immense amounts of experience with all of their basic action systems. At every point in development, perception guides motor behavior by providing feedback about the results of just prior movements and information about what to do next. Reciprocally, the development of motor behavior provides fodder for perception. More generally, motor development brings about new opportunities for acquiring knowledge about the world, and burgeoning motor skills can instigate cascades of developmental changes in perceptual, cognitive, and social domains.","Abstract:  The current study investigated age differences in free viewing gaze behavior. Adults and 6-, 9-, 12-, and 24-month-old infants watched a 60-sec Sesame Street video clip while their eye movements were recorded. Adults displayed high intersubject consistency in eye movements; they tended to fixate the same places at the same. Infants showed weaker consistency between observers and intersubject consistency increased with age. Across age groups, the influence of both bottom-up features (fixating visually salient areas) and top-down features (looking at faces) increased. Moreover, individual differences in fixating bottom-up and top-down features predicted whether infants’ eye movements were consistent with those of adults, even when controlling for age. However, this relation was moderated by the number of faces available in the scene, suggesting that the development of adult-like viewing involves learning when to prioritize looking at bottom-up and top-down features.","Abstract:  The current study investigated eye-hand coordination in natural reaching. We asked whether the speed of reaching related to the quality of visual information obtained by young children and adults. Participants played with objects on a table while their eye and hand movements were recorded. We developed new techniques to find reaching events in natural activity and to determine how closely participants aligned gaze to objects while reaching. Reaching speed and eye alignment were related for adults but not for children. These results suggest that adults but not children adapt reaching movements according to the quality of visual information (or vice-versa) during natural activity. We discuss possibilities for why this coordination was not observed in children.","Abstract:  Global visual processing is important for segmenting scenes, extracting form from background, and recognizing objects. Local processing involves attention to the local elements, contrast, and boundaries of an image at the expense of extracting a global percept. Previous work is inconclusive regarding the relative development of local and global processing. Some studies suggest that global perception is already present by 8 months of age, whereas others suggest that the ability arises during childhood and continues to develop during adolescence. We used a novel method to assess the development of global processing in 3- to 10-year-old children and an adult comparison group. We used Kanizsa illusory contours as an assay of global perception and measured responses on a touch-sensitive screen while monitoring eye position with a head-mounted eye tracker. Participants were tested using a similarity match-to-sample paradigm. Using converging measures, we found a clear developmental progression with age such that the youngest children performed near chance on the illusory contour discrimination, whereas 7- and 8-year-olds performed nearly perfectly, as did adults. There was clear evidence of a gradual shift from a local processing strategy to a global one; young children looked predominantly at and touched the “pacman” inducers of the illusory form, whereas older children and adults looked predominantly at and touched the middle of the form. These data show a prolonged developmental trajectory in appreciation of global form, with a transition from local to global visual processing between 4 and 7 years of age.","Abstract:  Possibilities for action depend on the fit between the body and the environment. Perceiving what actions are possible is challenging, because the body and the environment are always changing. How do people adapt to changes in body size and compression? In Experiment 1, we tested pregnant women monthly over the course of pregnancy to determine whether they adapted to changing possibilities for squeezing through doorways. As women gained belly girth and weight, previously passable doorways were no longer passable, but women’s decisions to attempt passage tracked their changing abilities. Moreover, their accuracy was equivalent to that of nonpregnant adults. In Experiment 2, nonpregnant adults wore a “pregnancy pack” that instantly increased the size of their bellies, and they judged whether doorways were passable. Accuracy in the “pregnant” participants was only marginally worse than that of actual pregnant women, suggesting that participants adapted to the prosthesis during the test session. In Experiment 3, participants wore the pregnancy pack and gauged passability before and after attempting passage. The judgments were grossly inaccurate prior to receiving feedback. These findings indicate that experience facilitates perceptual–motor recalibration for certain types of actions.","Abstract:  We propose a new way to describe affordances for action. Previous characterizations of affordances treat action possibilities as binary categories—either possible or impossible—separated by a critical point. Here, we show that affordances are probabilistic functions, thus accounting for variability in motor performance. By measuring an affordance function, researchers can describe the likelihood of success for every unit of the environment. We demonstrate how to fit an affordance function to performance data using established psychophysical procedures and illustrate how the threshold and variability parameters describe different possibilities for action. Finally, we discuss the implications of probabilistic affordances for development, perception, and decision making.","Abstract:  How does visual experience change over development? To investigate changes in visual input over the developmental transition from crawling to walking, thirty 13‐month‐olds crawled or walked down a straight path wearing a head‐mounted eye tracker that recorded gaze direction and head‐centered field of view. Thirteen additional infants wore a motion tracker that recorded head orientation. Compared to walkers, crawlers' field of view contained less walls and more floor. Walkers directed gaze straight ahead at caregivers, whereas crawlers looked down at the floor. Crawlers obtained visual information about targets at higher elevations—caregivers and toys—by craning their heads upward and sitting up to bring the room into view. Findings indicate that visual experiences are intimately tied to infants' posture.","Abstract:  Understanding visual attention in children could yield insight into how the visual system develops during formative years and how children’s overt attention plays a role in development and learning. We are particularly interested in the role of hands and hand activities in children’s visual attention. We use headmounted cameras to collect egocentric video and eye gaze data of toddlers during playful social interaction with their parents, and developed a computer vision system to track and label different hands within the child’s field of view. We report detailed results on appearance frequencies and spatial distributions of parents’ and children’s hands both in the child’s field of view and as the target of the child’s attentional fixation.","Abstract:  Egocentric cameras are becoming more popular, introducing increasing volumes of video in which the biases and framing of traditional photography are replaced with those of natural viewing tendencies. This paradigm enables new applications, including novel studies of social interaction and human development. Recent work has focused on identifying the camera wearer's hands as a first step towards more complex analysis. In this paper, we study how to disambiguate and track not only the observer's hands but also those of social partners. We present a probabilistic framework for modeling paired interactions that incorporates the spatial, temporal, and appearance constraints inherent in egocentric video. We test our approach on a dataset of over 30 minutes of video from six pairs of subjects.","Abstract:  Perceiving possibilities for action—affordances—requires sensitivity, accuracy, and consistency. In the current study, we tested children of different ages (16-month-olds to 7-year-olds) and adults to examine the development of affordance perception for reaching through openings of various sizes. Using a psychophysical procedure, we estimated individual affordance functions to characterize participants’ actual ability to fit their hand through openings and individual decision functions to characterize attempts to reach. Decisions were less accurate in younger children (16-month-olds to 5-year-olds); they were more likely to attempt impossible openings and to touch openings prior to refusing, suggesting a slow developmental trend in learning to perceive affordances for fitting through openings. However, analyses of multiple outcome measures revealed that the youngest participants were equally consistent in their decision making as the oldest ones and that every age group showed sensitivity to changes in the environment by scaling their attempts to opening size.","Abstract:  The current study investigated whether younger (college-age) and older adults (60+ years) differ in their ability to perceive safe and unsafe motor actions. Participants decided whether to walk through openings varying in width in two penalty conditions: In the doorway condition, if participants attempted to squeeze through impossibly narrow openings, the penalty for error was entrapment. In the ledge condition, if participants attempted to inch along impossibly narrow ledges, the penalty for error was falling. Results showed that across the lifespan, people consider falling to be a more severe penalty than getting stuck: Both younger and older adults made more conservative decisions when the penalty for error was falling, and older women were especially leery of falling. In both age groups, abilities and decisions were based on dynamic properties of the body, such as compressed body size in the doorway condition and balance in the ledge condition. Findings indicate that failure to perceive possibilities for action is unlikely to be the cause of the increased prevalence of falling in older adults.","Abstract:  What infants decide to do does not necessarily reflect the extent of what they know. In the current study, 17-month-olds were encouraged to walk through openings of varying width under risk of entrapment. Infants erred by squeezing into openings that were too small and became stuck, suggesting that they did not accurately perceive whether they could fit. However, a second penalty condition revealed accurate action selection when errors resulted in falling, indicating that infants are indeed perceptually sensitive to fitting through openings. Furthermore, independent measures of perception were equivalent between the two penalty conditions, suggesting that differences in action selection resulted from different penalties, not lack of perceptual sensitivity.","Abstract:  Walkers need to modify their ongoing actions to meet the demands of everyday environments. Navigating through openings requires gait modifications if the size of the opening is too small relative to the body. Here we ask whether the spatial requirements for navigating horizontal and vertical openings differ, and, if so, whether walkers are sensitive to those requirements. To test walkers’ sensitivity to demands for gait modification, we asked participants to judge whether they could walk through horizontal openings without shoulder rotation and through vertical openings without ducking. Afterward, participants walked through the openings, so that we could determine which opening sizes elicited gait modifications. Participants turned their shoulders with more space available than the space they left themselves for ducking. Larger buffers for horizontal openings may reflect different spatial requirements created by lateral sway of the body during walking compared to vertical bounce. In addition, greater variability of turning from trial to trial compared with ducking may lead walkers to adopt a more conservative buffer to avoid errors. Verbal judgments accurately predicted whether openings required gait modifications. For horizontal openings, participants’ judgments were best predicted by the body’s dynamic abilities, not static shoulder width. The differences between horizontal and vertical openings illustrate that walkers account for the dynamic properties of walking in addition to scaling decisions to body dimensions.","Abstract:  Understanding the development of mature motion processing may require knowledge about the statistics of the visual input that infants are exposed to, how these change across development, and how they influence the maturation of motion-sensitive brain networks. Here we develop a set of techniques to study the optic flow experienced by infants and mothers during locomotion as a first step toward a broader analysis of the statistics of the natural visual environment during development.","Abstract:  Despite hundreds of studies describing infants’ visual exploration of experimental stimuli, researchers know little about where infants look during everyday interactions. The current study describes the first method for studying visual behavior during natural interactions in mobile infants. Six 14-month-old infants wore a head-mounted eye-tracker that recorded gaze during free play with mothers. Results revealed that infants’ visual exploration is opportunistic and depends on the availability of information and the constraints of infants’ own bodies. Looks to mothers’ faces were rare following infant-directed utterances but more likely if mothers were sitting at infants’ eye level. Gaze toward the destination of infants’ hand movements was common during manual actions and crawling, but looks toward obstacles during leg movements were less frequent.","Abstract:  We investigated the effect of action performance on perceptual judgments by evaluating accuracy in judging whether doorways allowed passage. Participants made judgments either before or after walking through doorways of varying widths. Participants in the action-first group benefited from action feedback and made more accurate judgments compared to a perception-first group that judged doorways before walking through them. Action feedback aided perceptual judgments by facilitating scaling to body dimensions: Judgments in the action-first group were strongly related to height, weight, and torso size, whereas judgments in the perception-first group were not.","Abstract:  The current study showed that visual fixation of obstacles is not required for rapid and adaptive navigation of obstacles. Children and adults wore a wireless, head-mounted eye-tracker during a visual search task in a room cluttered with obstacles. They spontaneously walked, jumped, and ran through the room, stepping up, down, and over obstacles. Both children and adults navigated adaptively without fixating obstacles, however, adults fixated less often than children. We discuss several possibilities for why obstacle navigation may shift from foveal to peripheral control over development.","Abstract:  Currently, developmental psychologists rely on paradigms that use infants' looking behavior as the primary measure. Despite hundreds of studies describing infants' visual exploration of experimental stimuli, researchers know little about where infants look during everyday interactions. Head-mounted eye-trackers have provided many insights into natural vision in adults, but methods and equipment that work well with adults are not suitable for infants---the equipment is prohibitively big and calibration procedures too demanding. We outline the first method for studying mobile infants' visual behavior during natural interactions. We used a new, specially designed head-mounted eye-tracker to record 6 infants' gaze as they played with mothers in a room full of toys and obstacles. Using this method, we measured how infants employed gaze while navigating obstacles, manipulating objects, and interacting with mothers. Results revealed new insights into visually guided locomotor and manual action and social interaction.","Abstract:  This chapter has two major aims. The first is to describe flexibility in motor action. Balance and locomotion in infants are used as a test case for understanding three aspects of behavioral flexibility—adaptive motor decisions, modification of ongoing activity, and new means to achieve a goal. The second aim is to illuminate the links between flexibility and development. In particular, it demonstrates that flexibility is acquired during development and that developmental changes both facilitate and impede its acquisition. It is shown that flexibility does not automatically appear when infants acquire new forms of balance and locomotion. Instead, flexibility is learned over many weeks of everyday locomotor experience in a newly acquired posture. Infants learn how to learn as they acquire the appropriate exploratory behaviors for generating information about the current constraints on action and potential alternatives for achieving their goals.
