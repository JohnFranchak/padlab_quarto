PADLAB PI [John Franchak](https://padlab.ucr.edu/people/john-franchak.html) co-organized a pre-conference workshop with [Sam Wass](https://www.isey.org/isey-staff/sam-wass) and [Melina Knabe](https://www.la.utexas.edu/users/dil/team.html). The workshop "Machine Learning for Tracking Early Behavior and Environments" took place on September 16, 2025 as part of the [IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning](https://icdl2025.fel.cvut.cz/) in Prague, Czechia. The workshop featured 15 speakers with interdisciplinary expertise in perception, sleep, movement, language, emotion, and social interaction. Prof. Franchak gave a talk in the first session entitled "Full-day recordings of infant motor behavior" with doctoral students Hanzhi Wang and Hailey Rousey as co-authors.
