The Perception, Action, and Development Lab was awarded a 3-year, $423,915 [grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2521429&HistoricalAwards=false) from National Science Foundation's the Developmental Sciences Program. The project includes awards made to [Prof. Kari Kretch](https://sites.usc.edu/ldrlab/) at the University of Southern California and [Prof. Drew Abney](https://psychology.uga.edu/directory/people/drew-abney) at the University of Georgia who will collaborate on the project. This project aims to collect data from families across the United States by mailing wearable sensors for infants to wear over the course of a week, building on the PADLAB's prior development of this [technique](/posts/2023-imu-method.qmd). In contrast to current methods that rely on labor-intensive manual coding of infant movement data, this project leverages artificial intelligence to (1) measure the amount and types of movement that 7-month old infants engage in at home during a typical week, (2) examine caregiving practices that give rise to individual differences in opportunities for movement, and (3) predict individual differences in motor development outcomes, including sitting and standing proficiency, at 11 months of age. Collecting and sharing a large longitudinal dataset of wearable sensor data enables advances in understanding motor development trajectories as well as advances in artificial intelligence methods for robustly identifying human movement.
