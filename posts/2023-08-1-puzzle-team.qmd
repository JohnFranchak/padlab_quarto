Thank you for your interest in opening this news page! These are just some photo memories of a recent PhD. People celebrated my accomplishment of the dissertation project, but it was the result of the whole team (namely Team Puzzle because participants copied models in the study). I want to say thank you loudly to Faizah, the lead RA who had worked with me from freshman to senior year; Tiffany, the crisis manager who handled everything efficiently and united the team; David, a barrel of laughs, brought joy to routine boring tasks; Jocelyn, our lovely, caring, and conscientious professional; and Helen, who joined lastly but provided  big momentum in wrapping up the study in time. Because of you, my graduate years became more memorable. I am so thankful for having you!
