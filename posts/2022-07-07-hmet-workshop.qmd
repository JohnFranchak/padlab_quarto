During the ICIS 2022 Ottawa pre-conference day, I co-organized a workshop on infant head-mounted eye tracking with [Chen Yu](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/faculty/cy2856) (UT Austin) and [Irina Castellanos](https://medicine.osu.edu/find-faculty/clinical/otolaryngology/irina-castellanos-phd) (Ohio State). The workshop had two parts. In the first part, a tutorial covered best practices in collecting and analyzing head-mounted eye tracking data with infant participants. The second part consisted of three talks that showcased the use of head-mounted eye tracking in infant research.

I gave a presentation in the first part on data collection and coding, highlighting some of the [tools](/Tools.qmd) I've developed to [check eye tracking accuracy](/tools/accuracy.qmd), [import and visualize data](/tools/et_tools.qmd), and perform [region of interest coding](/tools/roi.qmd). A [video recording](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/osu.zoom.us/rec/share/5wuD2e5_YkF3c6jkqWMJJmyQKagieBtvjeTZSk-Eu7s4NomtbGBY35HaExTd43et.TeobpHwaHgKHuPBQ__;!!KGKeukY!wUBTINriaktlmhbCQvsQ_rAyIGdlMs7SZmod6FquXeIsUWJz1lg6LzmZwDNi-giNDsyrzHrpgFPlYojJntre8ro$) is available to watch the entire program (Chen Yu's data analysis part got pushed to the end because of a flight delay): 

- Karen Adolph - Introduction 
- John Franchak - Data Collection
- Sara Schroer - Data Quality
- David Crandall- Analyzing egocentric video and gaze data using computer vision
- Brianna Kaplan, Kelsey West, Justine Hoch, Karen Adolph - Head-mounted eye tracking reveals structure in children’s learning environments
- Irina Castellanos and Derek Houston- Effects of auditory experience on parent-child interactions
- Chen Yu - Data Analysis

We’ve created a [Github repository](https://github.com/ICIS-HMET-Workshop/workshop_materials_2022) that contains the schedule and resources to share. This [Github org page](https://github.com/ICIS-HMET-Workshop) links to the software packages that we discussed. Drop me a line if you end up trying out any of the software or have questions---I'm always happy to chat mobile eye tracking with friends, colleagues, or strangers!

I recorded my practice talk (didn't think I was going to make the conference due to COVID), so I shared that as a stand-alone presentation in case the Zoom recording expires
